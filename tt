1- Conceptual Soundness- does it make sense? This includes a thorough review
 of the assumptions and methodologies employed, as well as the data set
 used; it also involves identifying where the key assumptions are useable
 and where they are not.

non-replicable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first and foremost element that any scientific study needs to insure
 is replicable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, among 26 taxa that the author reviwied, 15 of them either suffers
 problems suchs missing data or regression equitions or lacks sufficient
 detailed analytical methods, all of which lead to impossible to be replicated
 or validated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Within those 11 taxa left, 7 of them have their esimted max group rate significa
ntly different from author's validated results, despire the author employed
 the same analytic methods as their papers stated.

Biased Data Input to assesse specimen maturity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the four taxa noted above that are best fit by asymptotic curves, with
 sdmaxw60%, three of them (Tyrannosaurus, Saurornitholestes and Hypacrosaurus)
 have sdmaxw90% indicating that the data sets include specimens that at
 leas
\series bold
t approach skeletal maturity
\series default
.
 But for the remaining ten taxa, the oldest specimens available are less
 than 62% of the asymptotic size predicted by their best-fitting asymptotic
 models.
 This finding suggests that the specimens for those taxa were skeletally
 immature at the time of death, and that the asymptotic fits may suffer
 from insufficient data.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Effects of Population Sampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 26.8% of the 500 bootstrap trials of the Tyrannosaurus 2 data set, an
 increasing curve was the best fit to the resampled data; in contrast, only
 asymptotic curves obtained strong statistical support when fit to the original
 data set.
 The reason is clear from examination of the data sets: the original data
 include only one very old specimen (age 28) and one very young specimen
 (age 2).
 If either or both of these data points are missing from a bootstrap trial,
 the data points in the middle may be best fit by a nonasymptotic function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Effects of Errors in Age Estimation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Monte Carlo simulation using normally distributed heteroscedastic errors
 in age added to the Tyrannosaurus 2 data set found that, whereas only asymptoti
c curves had strong statistical support when fit to the unadjusted data
 set, the best-fit model was an increasing function in 1% of the trials
 when 5% error was added to the age estimates.
 At 10% error, the proportion rose to 12.6%, and it increased further to
 19.8% when 15% random error was added to the data.
 This is in good agreement with the result found for Monte Carlo simulation
 on the effects of error on a synthetic data set (see Figure S10 and Text
 S5).
 This result suggests that even relatively small amounts of age estimation
 error can alter the pattern in the data so much that an asymptotic curve
 no longer offers the best fit

\begin_layout Subsection
Issues with Mass Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Issues with Mass Estimation Osteology is the source of all data on dinosaur
 growth, and questions about maximum asymptotic size (if any) and other
 biological characteristics can and should be answered directly from observation
s of bones.
 If estimated masses are needed, they would best be calculated only after
 statistical analysis has been performed on the osteological growth data.
 Performing mass estimation as an intermediate step prior to fitting a growth
 curve unnecessarily risks introducing error, which could confound the statistic
al analysis challenges already present in the osteology.
 Nevertheless, many

\begin_layout Subsection
Inappropriate choice of variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A bedrock assumption in ordinary least-squares regression (also known as
 Model I regression) is that the independent variable has no error; all
 error to be minimized by the regression procedure occurs only in the dependent
 variable [94].
 Model II regression (or Deming regression) distributes the error equally
 in independent and dependent variables [94].
 In dinosaur growth data sets, the bone dimensions are typically measured
 accurately to within a millimeter (except when fractured or incomplete),
 so they make a natural choice of independent variable for conventional
 regression.
 Age, in contrast, is estimated with considerably greater uncertainty, and
 for that reason it is the natural choice for the dependent variable.
 Using size rather than time as the independent variable has long been recommend
ed in studies of growth in extant animals [95].
