Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use the loss forecasting model to simulate the credit card portfolio
 under different economics scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also built the risk appetite framework, which are the maximum Loss we
 are willing to suffer in the recession.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Background: TOO BIG TO FAIL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
This exercise is required by
\series default
 the Federal Reserve, our regulators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
BECAUSE
\series default
 in the good time, like now, banks 
\series bold
tend
\series default
 to take higher risk, for example booking the low FICO customers,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
with the idea
\series default
 that if the crisis comes, they know the government will come to 
\series bold
SAVE
\series default
 them,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
because
\series default
 they are deeply rooted into the economy system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That is how we call too big to fail, or in economic theory, moral hazard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
IN DETAIL
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
So every quarter Federal Reserve will give us 3 economic scenarios, baseline,
 adverse and severely adverse.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And we 
\series bold
plug in
\series default
 those scenarios into our model to 
\series bold
test the sensitivity
\series default
 of our portfolio to economic macro factors,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The goal is to insure that
\series default
 if another financial crisis happens tomorrow 
\series bold
un-expectedly
\series default
, then we have enough capital to survive through it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
SUMMARY
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So our job is to insure our portfolio is 
\series bold
health enough today
\series default
 so that tomorrow when crisis happens when can survive by ourselves, 
\series bold
no need the taxpayer's money!

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometime the management question the model results, especially when the
 model predicts higher loss, which means you have to build reserve and shrink
 marking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we have to dig into the model and find what variable, in which step causes
 this anomaly.

we first decompose the NI into interest income, interchange, fees, loss.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use a weekly initial unemployment insurance claim (weekly IUIC) as our
 macro input, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We saw it dropped from 350 thousand to 250 thousand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But our loss forecasting goes up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I was assigned to this job to investigate why this counter-intuitive
 thing happens
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It turned out to be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our model, we didn't use the IUIC itself, we use the change of IUIC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But so as the actual IUIC dropped from 350 to 250, but the baseline scenario
 that Fed gave us, is always stabilize at 270,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So previously, we have a positive gap between actual and forecasting, thus
 a positive impact, now as the situation improves, we turned out to have
 a negative gap.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The takeaway is: ???
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probably the sensitivity between our portfolio to the change of IUIC is
 not constant, what I mean is the coefficient of the change of IUIC may
 be not constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be dependent on the level of IUIC itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the IUIC level is low, the sensitivity is low.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
we probably want to incorporate the level of IUIC, rather than only the
 change of IUIC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We got 3 seniors, 2 juniors plus our boss.

Normally whenever we want to transform the

 to 
\series bold

\series default
, I will do it.
 Because my background in Finance and I know those accounting rules, assumptions
, tricks,how to build and release reserves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Another case is whenever there is case that a project is super quant that
 Excel or SAS cannot handle, then it is my job to attack it solve it, because
 I love quant stuff and I love to coding in R.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
50% of time is to develop and maintain loss forecasting models for credit
 card and Personal loans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
50% of time is to sell our models to customers (marketing / finance).
 That turns out an equally interesting part as building the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our customers are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Largest customer is Marketing: when they need to design some new product,
 or new campaign, they have to come to us to let us run the product through
 our forecasting, to see whether they can make money.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
They have strong incentive to question our model accuracy, but only when
 our forecasting loss is too high and kills their product.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Treasury: report them DEFAST.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finance: loss reserve calculation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the model developing part, I recently redeveloped the whole personal
 consolidation loans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It can take care both loss and revenue.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Normally a loss forecasting model can only forecast loss and has nothing
 to do with revenue, which restrains the usage of the model.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Traditional model can only start from the very beginning of the loan, this
 model can start from any mob.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also this is the account level model, so you can group whatever way you
 want.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The structure of the model is flexible enough to be adapted to Mortgage
 and auto-loan.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Model: One Single Model for whole business
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So you see we have multiple customers: marketing, Treasury and Finance.
 So we have to build the forecasting model that is 
\series bold
generic and flexible enough
\series default
 that can serve those customers' need at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We don't want to build separate models just to serve separate customers
 and different proposes, because essentially they have the same purposes:
 measure the risk of a product under different scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So what we are trying to do now, is to build one single loss forecasting
 model for a product, and that model has enough 
\series bold
flexibility and scalability
\series default
 that can extent itself to model the loss at Campaign level, offer level,
 then all the way up to the whole portfolio level, which can be used for
 stress testing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise: have multiple models for that product: we have one model to decide
 the potential loss of a campaign, we have another model for collection,
 then we have another model for regulators, like stress testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AND to maintain those models turns out a huge 
\series bold
burden
\series default
 to a middle-size bank like us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Behavior: Team work Experience: work with marketing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example to work with marketing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our bank we have a monthly meeting to decide to whether mail a campaign,
 and I need to provide a loss forecasting for this campaign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If my loss forecasting is too high, and their campaign can not pass the
 Profit hurdle and so they cannot mail the campaign, so often they first
 come to us to argue the forecasting is way to high
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Be really 
\series bold
patient
\series default
, because they don't know your model at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
consistent
\series default
 : We also try our best to keep our loss forecasting 
\series bold
consistent
\series default
, so they can have a clear expectation of what offer will pass the profit
 hurdle, what will not.
 We don't want to give them a surprise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Be Proactive:
\series default
 Whenever we made saw some differences in forecasting, I don't wait them
 to come to me, I try to be active to, to talk to them first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Go further: make the model accessible to everyone.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is a huge change of our role: originally we are so obsessed with the
 modelling and just though out the output to our business partners, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we are trying to make the model as a 
\series bold
product
\series default
, 
\series bold
a product that is easy to be used by everyone
\series default
.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
So in this way, we build a very good working relationship.
 We still have tensions, because Credit Risk and Marketing are naturally
 having opposite interest: we want to control and they want to expand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
But by being more active, more consistent, and communicating more, we worked
 really well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Business: Serve Customer of Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "business-serve-customer-of-model"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Originally, our model is coded in R, and every time Marketing sends us the
 campaign they want to launch, we plug the characteristics of the campaign
 into our model and give the output back to marketing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem is, only we know how to play the model,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So to the marketing people, our model is a 
\series bold
black box
\series default
, or our whole risk department is a black box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But they user and consumer of the model, don't even have access to the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The efficacy /ˈefəkəsē/ of your model does not only depend on the model
 itself, but on how the model users use the result your model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
So what I did there, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
instead of using the model for each campaign at one time and using the model
 only we know the campaign.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I summarized all the historical campaigns and find all possible combination,
 for example, different combinations of APR, fees, channels etc.
 In total there are hundreds of possible campaigns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Output the model's result into a pivot table in excel, with some dynamic
 graphs, where you can click the VBA button so that they can choose mix
 of offers, channels and segmentation and automatically see the loss curve
 and profit curve.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
So after this become a user tool, when marking design their offer, they
 will see the profitability and loss vividly

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Business: Communicating with Marketing in loss curves
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Background:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
There is a natural conflict between any marketing person and a risk person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They have strong interests to question the accuracy of our loss curves,
 but only when it is so high to let their campaign fail in P&L evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They are non- technical people; they have no idea in 
\series bold
overfitting
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EXAMPLE: sometimes you have to convince them one good performance campaign
 cannot represent anything, what we want to see is a continues good performance
 for all similar campaigns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You have to really show a large amount of historical data and show them
 graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Be active: talk to them before they talk to you.
 To show you are a

 person.

\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Be consistent on your result 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Be Patient 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Model: UCL forecasting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
complications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ultimate goal is to build a model that can forecast loss curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several features for this model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 For each time, we just forecast one period ahead, then we plug in the predicted
 result into the model again to forecast one period further.
 First from to T to T+1, then based on predictions on T+1, we predict T+2.
 So we keep doing this kind of thing recursively till T+N.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a reason we design our model in this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is hard to find a closed form equation to generate a curve at once.
 When you are talking a loss curve, that is the loss dollar rate for 60
 months or even 72 months.
 It is hard to use a single equation to describe the shape of the curve,
 how high the peak is, when is the peak, what happens after the peak (should
 it stay high, or sharply decrease or slowly decrease).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Also accounts with different FICO or in different loan terms shall naturally
 have different shapes of the curve.
 When I mean different shapes I mean you cannot just adjust the curve proportion
ally to fit different risk groups.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
2 Another feature of this model is, this model predicts every aspect of
 an account behaviors, including charge-off, delinquent, early payment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way we are doing this is, we create multiple equations and each equation
 just described one single kind of behavior.
 When we use them, we link them together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the first LOGIT equation to predict charge-off, then we simulate
 accounts through this equation,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
if the account is not predicted to be charged off, 
\series bold
then given that updated information
\series default
, we plug it in the second equation to predict delinquency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then third one is, 
\series bold
given they are not delinquent,
\series default
 whether they will do early pay, the fourth one is given they will do early
 pay, how much they will pay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
So each time, we just focus on one kind of behavior, then predict it, then
 given the updated information to predict another kind of behavior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The dollar loss rate is determined by the probability of charge off, but
 also determined by the charge off amount
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
So to predict PD is not enough, so you to predict balance, and to predict
 balance, you have to predict the payment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
PD and EAD are not separated things.
 They are interactive with each other.
 They shall be incorporated in the one forecasting system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
If you really want to forecast dollar loss rate correctly, you have to forecast
 things beyond loss correctly.

\series default
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
So in this way, we decompose the complexity of different customer behaviors
 each single component, and by linking these different equations, we can
 forecast the PD and EAD together, simultaneously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Project: credit card model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For credit card model, my job is to maintain it and improve it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Originally it was purely excel-based and required a lot manual effort when
 you want to use the model.
 There are 
\series bold
v-loop up
\series default
, 
\series bold
update pivot table
\series default
, 
\series bold
VBA
\series default
 and 
\series bold
solver
\series default
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
..
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Excel is best for some simple and stable model, but when things become complex
 and you keep adding new features into it, it is very easy to break down
 and become un-maintainable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout --Separator--

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We have a 3-page long document to explain
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
what shall do, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
what you shall watch out, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
what you might be missing when you use model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So it normally requires 30 minutes to generate one single curve 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So after I took over the job I completely re-wrote the whole thing using
 R.
 So now it is super user-friendly, you just need to type the input of a
 campaign (PA/ITA, DM/BRANCH, BT/PO\SpecialChar \ldots{}
..)\SpecialChar \ldots{}

Team: Credit Card strategy team
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our team owns every kind of credit risk policy of credit card after we book

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We design strategies for different actions on customers.
 For example, when we give you an offer, line increase, line decrease, suspensio
n, authorization of contain transactions, especially when those transactions
 are over limit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also we need to communicate with marketing, IT and customer service people,
 to insure they understand our strategy, and listen feedback from them,
 because eventually It is those colleagues who implement our strategies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our campaign is not only about booking as many as customers, but also about
 bringing in high profit and low risk customer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BUT normally marketing only cares response rate, so they have strong interest
 to go for the high risk customers and give them good offers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But our risk team is really responsible to control the risk exposure of
 our portfolio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this is an OPTIMIZATION problem in which you have to really combine the
 response rate and profit per customer together, to maximize the overall
 profit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So this is different from the online campaign for some Internet companies.
 They only have one-step problem -- book as many as customers as they can
 -We get a two-step problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But we never achieve this global optimization, because different departments
 are deeply siloed.
 Instead, we just design some minimum risk criteria, and thus any campaign
 passed that criteria, we can send out.

Project: Inactive Closure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The longer the card stays inactive, the less probability it will be come
 active.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And when it became active, it became more and more riskier.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
We call them timing bomb, because if an economic crisis happens, those guys
 might suddenly use our card and charge-off.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
But you don't want to close them too early, because if they become active,
 you still have the chance of making money from them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the optimal closure for an account is to evaluate marginal cost = marginal
 benefit of maintaining them
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marginal cost is maintaining an account one more month.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Marginal benefit is all the expected profit when it becomes active multiply
 the probability of becoming active next month.
 Note that the profit might be negative even.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And the dynamics of MC and MR changes as the account remains in inactive
 longer and longer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So by applying this simple economic ideas to this problem, we find a way
 to identify the optimal points of closing an account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conclusion: we apply our method to different customers in different risk
 groups, find different optimal closure points for them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Product: Consistency of risk policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One big thing we did when I was there is,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We group all of our actions into two groups: positive actions and negative
 actions, and we re-design all of our strategies to make sure that a customer
 who gets positive action from us will not receive a negative action within
 three months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
This idea is to insure consistency and clearness when you do actions on
 customers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This idea may sound like simple and natural but we didn't realize until
 2012.
 Example: Before that, one customer can get a marketing offer from us and
 then suddenly get a line decrease, simply because these two strategies
 did not talk to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Sometimes I think, as analysts, we are too obsessed into building each individua
l strategies along, but forget the big picture, which is different strategies
 have to work together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we decided to group customers to LOW, MEDIUM/LOW, MH, HIGH.
 Positive actions only happen in LOW and ML, negative actions only happen
 in HIGH.
 For Medium High, we leave it as grey area and has no action on it, neither
 positive or negative actions.
 So that we create a 
\series bold
grey area between good customers and bad customers, even if they migrate,
 it is hard for them to migrate directly from ML to H.
\end_layout

R packages

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Behavior: Why R package
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you got some ideas, or when you build some cool stuff, you really want
 to show off to people, and the best way to show off to people is to share
 it by contributing open-source projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And this sharing process also in turn force you to improve and refine your
 work.
 You want to really make it elegant, simple and user friendly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got emails from Singapore, Brazil and India.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is exciting that someone in the world is actually using your work to
 do their own stuff.
 So I think that's exactly why there are so many people want to contribute
 their work to open source software's like R or Python.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Model: cointegration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally stock prices are un-predictable because they are 
\series bold
random walk and thus not stationary.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
F(x_t1+
\backslash
tau,\SpecialChar \ldots{}
.x_tk+
\backslash
tau) = F(x_t1,\SpecialChar \ldots{}
.x_tk)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But there is one professor called Granger: he found although each single
 random walk along might be un-stationary and un-predictable, but when you
 combine them, they may have a 
\series bold
stationary
\series default
 relationship between each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, you may always find the UK market and US market move together.
 That is a simple 2-dimentional stationary relationship between non- stationary
 time series
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Speaking in mathematics
\series default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
there might exist a stable linear combination of random walks.

\begin_layout Itemize
If there are N random walks in your system, then at most there are N-1 such
 linear combinations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Common Trend
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When there are N-1 linear combinations, we call it we only have one-degree
 of freedom in the system, or in other words: there is only one stochastic
 common trend that drives the whole different N random walks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also if there are N-2 linear combinations, then there are 2 common trend
 driving the N random walks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Common Trend
\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there are one single common trend, that means the whole stock markets
 in the world are driven by one single global risk factor.
 That means the global stock market is fully integrated.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Getting Variables from a Formula
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a quite fundamental and infrastructure-like work, and it is not
 super hard to do, and I'm surprised that no one has done it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of times you want to extract THE variables you are using in a formula,
 for example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Y = X + X‸2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then depend on what's your background and the empirical context, there are
 two answers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One: there is two variables there: X and X‸2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second: there is only one variable: X
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of empirical economist tend to think there is only one variable there,
 as they care about how to quantify the relations between X and Y, not the
 particular coefficient of X‸2 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more complex case is: using a categorical variable: Categorical variables
 do not appear in the model as their original format.
 R will think an K-class variable as K-1 variables using certain Contrast
 Coding Systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Model: Intuition 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of times when we build parametric models, especially linear models,
 we already have PRIOR KNOWLEDGE about how certain independent variables
 may impact the dependent variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, when we build models to forecast whether a customer will pay
 us or not, when know the Unemployment rate will contribute to delinquent
 rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Normally we use both the level form of U and the squared form of it.
 So you want to insure that the 
\series bold
combination
\series default
 of U and squared U has a positive impact on delinquency rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that the 
\series bold
combined
\series default
 marginal impact here is not just coefficient of U + coefficient of squared
 U.
 You have to do 
\series bold
Partial Derivatives
\series default
 to get the true marginal impact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A more complex case is, you may INTERACT this U with other variables, for
 example, you expect the 
\series bold
recession
\series default
 may hit the Low FICO/Low Income harder, than HIGH FICO/high Income people
 -
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

- They are more robust to the economic downturn.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the first functionality of my package is to evaluate the marginal impact
 assumptions, test the 
\series bold
Monotonicity
\series default
 (because you are using the squared unemployment, the when you visualize
 it, it is a quadratic curve, which may peak at some where) and also visualize
 it using ggplot2, ALL done in one function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then when you build models, you really want to plug in that PRIOR KNOWLEDGE
 into your standard machine learning process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, stepwise regression.
 For each iteration they selection models according to AIC or BIC only,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My package provides another function that you can specify the marginal effect
 you want, so that in each iteration of stepwise regression, they will first
 exclude all the models with wrong marginal effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We call this marginal effect of one independent variable to the depend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Direction of the impact / size of the impact 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Knowledge: Stochastic Finance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because stocks prices are random walk in discrete times, when you want to
 apply the normal calculus on this kind of time series, it doesn't work
 simplify the series is not smooth, actually it is pointy everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental part of Stochastic Finance is to solve this problem: Ito

Business: a credit card offers

\begin_layout Standard
Three aspects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Introductory offer: either BT / Purchasing / One--time reward
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
What is BT-fee, what is the duration of the introductory-offer 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The goal of the introductory offer is to seduce customers to respond to
 your campaign (either direct mail / in-branch / email).
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Portfolio Offer: after acquisition, to maintain the customer or complete

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Transaction-level offer: which is mainly Reward
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It is costly to the bank 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The purpose of reward is to seduce customers to use our card, and hopefully
 they cannot fully payback in each cycle, and thus 
\series bold
turn them from translator to revolvers
\series default
.
 Thus we can charge them high APR 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection
Modeling: Pricing of Loans / Credit Card in Marketing Campaigns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go-To rate.
 This is the APR we talk about often.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I found customers are not very sensitive to go to rate, at least not as
 sensitive to Intro-offers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We measure sensitivity using 
\series bold
response rate\SpecialChar \ldots{}
.

\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So one tactic we use is to give Super good Intro-offer to seduce customers
 open the card and build balance.
 And then charge them high go-to APR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is super hard to have a closed-form equation that can optimize every
 aspect of pricing, because there are so many factors complicate things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Pricing is just not APR,
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
it has Intro / Reward \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 It has BT/Purchasing \SpecialChar \ldots{}
.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Pricing is 
\series bold
not an One Stage thing
\series default
, it 
\series bold
is not decided in the acquisition level
\series default
 
\series bold
along
\series default
 and never change, because when you book the account, (booking is costly)
 you have to maintain the account, (attached rather than detached)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So you have to take care of pricing of any 
\series bold
portfolio management offer, rather than just acquisition level
\series default
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Pricing cannot simply be based on risk.
 Because through 
\series bold
Adverse Selection
\series default
, pricing on the other hand can affect the risk.
 We cannot simply adjust the pricing proportionally according to FICO or
 other risk factor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Even if you found the perfect pricing where you can optimize your profit
 on each single card member, this does not mean it is an optimization for
 
\series bold
overall profit
\series default
.
 The overall profit = Profit for each responder MULTIPLY by number of responders.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So you really want to

release some profit to customers by lowering the price to get more competitive
 and get more responders.

\series default
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Customers are never homogenous, there are translators /revolvers.
 There are smart customers that shop different cards for rich intro-offers.
 There are loyal customers who are so conservative and just use your card.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So you want to design offers for each of the single type of the customer.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If there is a possible way to attach this problem, you want to design a
 model for each of the single aspect of the pricing, and link the model
 together.
 Then simulate the results through this

The consumer banking industry define risks as probability of loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we buy stocks we take some 
\series bold
Idiosyncratic
\series default
 risk, because we only certain amount of stocks and we didn't diversity
 enough.
 So there is uncertainty there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when we make loans, for each risk group we have hundreds of thousands
 of customers, so by law of large number our return will converge to average
 return of that risk group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the only risk we are taking is systematic risk, the risk that caused
 by the fluctuation of macro economy and will affect every single customer
 at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are willing to take this risk because

Not because your model is not robust or sounded, just because they don't
 like the result of your model, for example, your forecasting may suggest
 a completely opposite story that the management committee believe.

In my case, I'm doing loss forecasting for marketing.
 They question my model only when the loss forecasting is too high and kill

Why came to America

\begin_layout Standard
In UIUC:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Professors are nice, students are hard-working.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This is the country I want to study and live.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
So when I graduated, I got graduate school offers from Cambridge and Oxford,
 but I also got the Duke offer.
 So I think, if I do graduate school in UK, I will probably stay in UK forever.
 So I decided, if I really want to come to America, this is time!

Why First National Bank of Omaha

\begin_layout Enumerate
My original goal is to apply Finance PhD.
 So I applied the five or three of the top 20 schools, but it turned out
 that the admission of Finance PhD is super competitive, and normally they
 just enroll 2-3 people each year.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
So you see I was over-confident about my self at that time.
 AND when it came to 2013 March, I got rejections from all of those schools.

So I say if I cannot stay in academia, let's try Industry.

Why change from Policy to Risk 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because one guy who worked on loss forecasting left, and the manager in
 loss forecasting approached me to see why I like to move.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I say why not.
 It is always good to try some new things and get challenged.
 You know when you stay in one area too long, you become more and more comfortab
le with your work, and thus your learning curve gets flatter and flatter,
 and you slowly loose your passion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I think the ideal situation is, you keep yourself being challenged, learning
 and trying new things.
 That's how you advance in your career.
