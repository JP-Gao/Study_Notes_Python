Permission marketing 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Permission marketing is a relatively new term, which was coined and developed
 by the entrepreneur, Seth Godin.[1] Traditional methods of marketing often
 revolve around the idea of attracting the customer’s attention away from
 whatever they are doing – whether it is a television advertisement that
 cuts into a TV show, or an internet pop-up that interferes with a website.
 According to Seth Godin, such traditional methods of advertising (often
 referred to as “Interruption marketing”), have become less effective in
 the modern world, where consumers are overloaded with information.[2] Therefore,
 Godin has developed the idea of permission marketing.
 Permission marketing is the opposite of interruption marketing; instead
 of interrupting the customer with unrequested information, permission marketing
 aims to sell goods and services only when the prospect gives consent in
 advance to receive the marketing information.[3]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Opt-in email is a prime example of Permission marketing, where Internet
 users sign-up (in other words give permission) to receive information about
 a certain product or a service.[4] Supporters of Permission marketing claim
 it to be effective, as the potential client would be more interested in
 information that was requested in advance.
 It is also more cost-efficient in comparison to traditional marketing methods,
 as businesses only need to target consumers who have expressed an interest
 in their product.[5]

\begin_layout Standard
All of this falls under the line of two of the most important use cases
 that we want to focus on, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
News.
 And we think Twitter is better at real-time news and live news than anyone
 else on the platform – in the world, I should say.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Social commentary.
 Anyone can comment about what's happening now and share their thoughts,
 and sometimes those go into conversation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, that's what we want to make stronger and also easier.
 So, four areas that we've been focused on there.
 Number one is around on-boarding.
 We've been applying a lot more machine learning and deep learning to our
 on-boarding, so we can match people faster to their interests.
 And we believe that that interest drive is really important to us and unique
 to us.
 Two, is the timeline where 
\series bold
causal effects of international initiatives people
\series default
 spend the majority of their time.
 We've made a number of refinements over the past few months to make sure
 that we're showing what's most important and what really matters, and enabling
 people to quickly get back to everything and to recency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notifications is another area where we think we can do a much better job,
 especially around breaking news.
 And not that we just push you into a tweet that dead ends, but we can enable
 you to further explore topics around that tweet and that interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hashtag From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: A sign suggesting the use
 of a #TimeToAct hashtag at a 2014 conference A hashtag is a type of label
 or metadata tag used on social network and microblogging services which
 makes it easier for users to find messages with a specific theme or content.
 Users create and use hashtags by placing the hash character (or pound sign)
 # in front of a word or unspaced phrase, either in the main text of a message
 or at the end.
 Searching for that hashtag will then present each message that has been
 tagged with it.
 A hashtag archive is consequently collected into a single stream under
 the same hashtag.[1]

Moments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real question is what value casual, lapsed, and non-users of Twitter
 will find in Moments — and that’s much harder to answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their bias is toward tweets from the source: people who are on the scene,
 or are directly involved in the news story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we try to do is just immerse you in the content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it sounds like Twitter is now running a media company inside a technology
 company, that’s because it is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One aspect of Moments I didn’t see coming: not every story captures a real-time
 event.
 The company is also packaging together evergreen stories ("Catch a wave,"
 a collection of surfing pictures and videos) and offering them up to browse.
 It's building moments to tell stories that take place over weeks or months
 — a rookie's first month in the National Hockey League, for example, or
 the story of the Los Angeles Dodgers' season.

Advertising inventory is the number of advertisements, or amount of ad space,
 a publisher has available to sell to an advertiser.
 Ad inventory is often calculated by the month.
 The term can refer to ads in print or other traditional media but is increasing
ly used to refer to online or mobile ads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes.
 So, on the online budgets, these are a set of budgets that we don’t have
 exposure to today, because they require a certain set of features that
 we are working on right now.
 These are features like demographic targeting and validation, GRP and TRP,
 targeting and reporting.
 So, it’s a function of putting these features in place.
 We believe that we can tap into incremental video budgets when we put those
 features in place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DoubleClick deal.
 DCM as you mentioned, which is around measurement.
 And DBM, which is around ad buying.
 So let me start with the DCM piece measurement.
 In the quarter, we expanded the beta over a dozen advertisers and we have
 run hundreds of campaigns now through DCM.
 We have seen two things.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One, when measuring desktop impressions to desktop conversions, the data
 looks accurate through DCM and the results for Twitter for these campaigns
 looks strong.
 So that’s good news.
 When on the other edge – on the other side of the house, when you look
 at mobile impressions that are measured through DCM that are measuring
 desktop conversions, so this cross-device measurement, what we saw through
 the measurement period is that something that the industry overall needs
 to address which is that this type of cross-device measurement overall
 need to work from an industry standpoint.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is something that we are working with Google together on.
 It’s part of the reasons why we did the DoubleClick deal in the first place
 is to help solve some of this cross-device measurement for the overall
 industry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This hits us particularly in an acute way because 90% of our impressions,
 our ad impressions are on mobile.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So cross-device for us is really important part.
 On the DBM side, Google engineers and Twitter engineers are working on
 the buying piece for integration.
 We believe it will be in beta in Q3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the SMB side, we were up on a year-on-year basis overall in active advertiser
s and it was driven by our SMB initiatives.
 SMB for us is an exciting opportunity because we have identified close
 to 9 million businesses who have setup shop on Twitter and are using it
 organically.
 Our goal is to move those 9 million businesses through the funnel to become
 active advertisers on the platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we look at our top 10 vertical categories, QSR, quick serve restaurants,
 as well as retail were two categories that performed decidedly lower than
 the rest of the overall business, which are macro driven categories.

you have a table where you have date, user_id, song_id and count.
 It shows at the end of each day how many times in her history a user has
 listened to a given song.
 So count is cumulative sum.
 You have to update this on a daily basis based on a second table that records
 in real time when a user listens to a given song.
 Basically, at the end of each day, you go to this second table and pull
 a count of each user/song combination and then add this count to the first
 table that has the lifetime count.
 If it is the first time a user has listened to a given song, you won't
 have this pair in the lifetime table, so you have to create the pair there
 and then add the count of the last day.

Medallions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Because the medallion system artificially restricts the number of cabs,

 which has in turn created a black market for illegal taxicab operation
 in areas undeserved by medallion cabs.[76]

\begin_layout Itemize
Because the cost of leasing a medallion is so high, the system may cut into
 the income of drivers and raise costs to passengers.

On the other hand, some transportation analysts contend that cities with
 no barriers to entry to the taxi market end up with an abundance of poorly

Pricing to drive the supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supply: the reality is that the times when people most want a ride are also
 the times when it’s most annoying and, often, most risky to drive.
 Rush hour, New Year’s Eve, 2 a.m.
 on a Saturday night, snowstorms: generally speaking, these are exactly
 the times when a driver doesn’t want to be on the road.
 But if driving at those times pays considerably better, then they are more
 likely to be willing.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Cost/Risk of driving in rush hours is high

 opportunities.
 Prt-time drivers may have other part-time jobs.
 Drivers have lucrative alternative opportunities on event nights like New
 Years Eve.
 Some party-goers are willing to book a single captive driver for a flat
 rate which could be well over $1000 for the night.
 And in this case, the driver enjoys quite a bit of downtime.

 find a rental car, or jump on a bus or subway.
 You will find that availability and reliability for all forms of transportation
 are under stress at that same precise moment in time.
 At these times, a fixed price taxi will be highly unavailable, and a fixed
 price subway will be remarkably over-crowded.

Difference between Uber and Others Dynamic Pricing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is, however, one key difference that materially increases the need
 for dynamic pricing in Uber’s case.
 With hotels, airplanes, and rental cars, supply is relatively fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Others tend to lower the price dynamically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why people hates dynamic pricing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Price of taxi is pre-set up and regulated for decades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Most people thought “raising prices in response to a shortage is unfair
 even when close substitutes are readily available”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Customers seem to accept dynamic pricing more easily when it’s characterized
 as a discount.
 At the movies, for instance, prime-time tickets aren’t presented as a few
 dollars more than the normal price—rather, matinees are presented as a
 few dollars less.

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Best marketing is education.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
empathetic / sympathy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another point to keep in perspective is that the operator of each and every
 car on the Uber service is a human just like all of the passengers.
 Why should we expect that individual to be excited about working precisely
 when we want to be out of the town? Do you enjoy working on Friday and
 Saturday night? What about Holidays? What about New Year’s Eve? Nurses
 and doctors routinely receive 2-3X overtime pay for work at those times;
 is there a reason that a driver should not? What about during really bad
 storms? Should the independent driver be more concerned about your needs,
 or those of their own family and friends? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is not a plea for you to be overly 
\series bold
empathetic
\series default
 for the independent drivers on Uber’s system, but rather simply asking
 you to consider the basic human reasons why they may chose not to drive
 at the exact same time that you are most interested in not driving.
 Is it unreasonable to expect higher fares if they are sacrificing their
 own time at the least convenient moment?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Subsidies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The company itself should take no money during surge periods (it now takes
 20 percent of every fare), so all the money goes to the drivers.
 Or it should cap prices to consumers but pay the higher price to drivers,
 essentially subsidizing people’s rides in surge periods.
 Or when prices rise really sharply, Uber should donate its take to charity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Matching Algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Timing is everything at Uber.
 Given a pickup location, drop off location and time of the day, predictive
 models developed at Uber predict how long will it take for a driver to
 cover the distance.
 Uber has 
\series bold
sophisticated routing and matching algorithms
\series default
 that direct cars to people and people to places.
 Right from the time you open the uber app till you reach your destination,
 Uber’s routing engine and matching algorithms are hard at work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uber follows a supplier pick map matching algorithm where the customer selects
 the variables associated with a service (in this case Uber app) and makes
 a match by sending requests to the most optimal list of service providers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any Uber ride request is first sent to the nearest available.
 Uber driver (the nearest available Uber driver is determined by comparing
 the customer location with the expected time of arrival of the driver).
 The Uber driver then accepts or rejects a ride request.
 This matching algorithm works well for Uber since the transaction is highly
 commoditized i.e.
 the number of variables that the customer has to decide before a match
 is made are minimal.

Goal:

Goal 1 -- take the market share / be the low-cost leader: Price is as low
 as possible so that as many as possible riders can be taken through Uber.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Goal 2 (not that possible): max profit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually when Uber takes 20% of the price as revenue, the goal 1 and goal
 2 is is them same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Uber uses a mixture of internal and external data to estimate fares.
 Uber calculates fares automatically using street traffic data, GPS data
 and its own algorithms that make alterations based on the time of the journey.
 It also analyses external data like public transport routes to plan various
 services.

Asymmetric Information:

\begin_layout Itemize
riders know where and when they will show up and the price they want to

drivers didn't know

\begin_layout Standard
So Uber needs to inform the diriver so that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they know where to go in the next hour / where to go get the highest 
\series bold
price per mile
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Insurance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HALL: For example, the median Uber driver, driver partner, drives 10 hours
 a week.
 So it’s not a full-time position.
 In New York City, the median driver drives significantly more than that.
 And one of the reasons for that is that there’s a substantial requirement
 on insurance that requires that the car that the driver has be insured
 all the time.
 And the result of that is there’s a strong economic incentive for drivers
 to drive a lot because they don’t want to pay for a full-time insurance
 policy and then only drive part time.
 They’ll end up losing money.
 So we’re encouraging policies that mandate things like insurance during
 the time when a driver is driving but do not restrict part-time drivers
 from joining the platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Demand Curve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LEVITT: I wish that that were really true.
 We have estimated really, really well a demand curve.
 So the only sad part about this — because I’m so excited to have estimated
 a demand curve — is that it’s actually not the demand curve I wanted to
 estimate at all.
 It’s the only one I could estimate but not the one I really wanted.
 So for public policy, like in deciding how to regulate Uber, for instance,
 the demand curve you’d love to have is what we call a long-term demand
 curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we want to know how consumers would respond over the course of say, six
 months or a year, to changes in pricing of Uber.
 And that would give them time to respond and make other kinds of accommodations
 if Uber either got more expensive or less expensive.
 The actual demand curve we estimate is really almost like, you call it,
 an instantaneous demand curve.
 I open the app.
 I either buy it or not.

\begin_layout Standard
While updating account information 
\series bold
is an infrequent task,
\series default
 drivers can now manage their profile from within the app.
 Help articles are just as easy to access as before, and reaching out to
 an Uber support representative is a few taps away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Heat Map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Heat map In the old driver app, the heat map only appeared to drivers when
 they were driving and it only lit up at times when surge pricing was in
 effect.
 We redesigned the heat map to provide drivers with recommended areas for
 where they’re most likely to get their next ride even when it’s not surging.
 That means less time waiting for a trip and less gas wasted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Part 2 Experiment and metrics design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[3 points] The Driver Experience team has just finished redesigning the
 Uber Partner app .
 The new version expands the purpose of the app beyond just driving.
 It includes additional information on earnings, ratings, and provides a
 unified platform for Uber to communicate with its partners.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
1.
 Propose and define the primary success metric of the redesigned app.
 What are 2-3 additional tracking metrics that will be important to monitor
 in addition to the success metric defined above? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our assumption is that the redesigned app can help drivers to do their jobs
 more effectively, productively and rider-friendly, which will causes better
 ratings, more trips and eventually increased earnings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Primary success metrics: revenue earned by drivers, or more precisely, it
 could be the incremental revenue earned by drivers during the first month
 after they receive the redesigned app, compared with those who use the
 old version of apps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Other Metrics
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Number of completed trips.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ratings for the drivers.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
2.
 Outline a testing plan to evaluate if redesigned app performs better (according
 to the metrics you outlined).
 How would you balance the need to deliver quick results, with statistical
 rigor, and while still monitoring for risks? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will design an A/B test by using a ramp-up approach.
 In this way, we can monitor the risk, prevent early bugs, and at the same
 time quickly (in an exponential speed) bring enough drivers into the treatment
 group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ramp up the treatment group exponentially in a stepwise way: do not let
 all drivers in the treatment group receive the redesigned app at once,
 but first open it to the 0.1% of them in the beginning.
 If everything goes well, then ramp up to 0.5%, then 2.5%, then 10%, and finally
 to 100% of the pre-defined size of treatment group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each step of ramp-up, monitor the KPIs for both driver and riders within
 the treatment group, and only ramp up to the next level of sample size
 when no anomaly/bugs observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, to insure statistical rigor: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Define minimum sample size to achieve the significance, expected lift and
 power of the test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Not just use random sampling, but use 
\series bold
Stratified Sampling, 
\series default
to insure balance of groups for each key markets/cities of Uber.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
To insure quick results 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Bring more drivers into the treatment group than the requirement of minimum
 sample size
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
3.
 Explain how you would translate the results from the testing plan into
 a decision on whether to launch the new design or roll it back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At the overall level.
 first run a T-test to see whether the drivers with redesigned apps performs
 better in completed trips, ratings and revenue, compared with the control
 group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then for each segmentation of drivers (different cities, part-time vs full
 time, age, iPhone vs Android), test whether the treatment group performs
 better.
 In this way we can explore possibilities of personalization, according
 to drivers geography and characteristics.

FIRST REPUBLIC INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1-Thanks for setting up the call.
 I spoke with 
\series bold
Sam
\series default
 yesterday and the conversation went pretty well.
 He asked questions about my background, what I do in my current role, how
 I would handle large data sets/doing calculations in Excel, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He asked if I knew VLOOKUP (I said I did, and I use INDEX-MATCH instead,
 which he was impressed with).
 He told me about the company and what areas he manages, and he asked what
 I was looking for in a role--if I'd be ok with preparing reports for senior
 management, or working on data-intensive projects for a few months at a
 time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He also asked about R and what I've done with it so far.
 He also asked me if I knew what a CUSIP was (I do), and he asked me if
 I knew what the duration of a bond was (I do).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He asked what impact does the duration have/what does it mean/what does
 it represent.
 This one I sort of stumbled with because the question wasn't all that clear.
 He was essentially asking to see if I knew that when the yield of the bond
 goes up, the price of the bond goes down, and vice versa.
 Also, longer duration bonds will generally have a higher yield than shorter
 duration bonds, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2-Basically most of the interview started with going over the resume in
 details, then questions like the following: In sum, they asked me tons
 of technical questions - ranging from basic compound interest problems
 (Sam) to spurious regressions in R (Eugene).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I answered about 80 percent of the questions correctly, and I solved about
 10 percent more with the hints they gave me (partial help).
 Moreover, I could not solve various problems including a combinatorics
 problem (Atanas) dealing with horses in a racetrack, and a factorial problem
 (related to 47 factorial) that Eugene gave me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The questions 
\series bold
Eric
\series default
 asked were not too hard, although some did take me a while to get the answer.
 He first started out by asking me to go through my resume, which I did,
 but we stopped before we got to the project section of my resume.
 Here are some questions he asked me to test my knowledge: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 What are forwards and futures and the difference between them? I got the
 first part right in that one party agree to pay a certain price for a product
 or service to the other party at a specified date in the future.
 Unfortunately, I messed up when I got future and options confused, but
 he quickly pointed out to me this mistake, so I proceeded to tell him that
 one difference was the futures can be traded with other parties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this part, we moved to other questions.
 In hindsight, I should have said more about their differences, such as
 futures are exchange traded and forwards are not, forwards are more customized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 What is CAPM? I felt that I answered this well, in that we need the risk
 free rate, market returns, and beta (market risk exposure) to calculate
 what the rate of return should be on a given stock.
 I did not give him the formula to calculate it though, so I do not know
 if that is a problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Asked what k-means clustering is but I did not know that, but I did know
 what k nearest neighbor is, which is similar to k-means clustering, and
 explained that to him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.

 n=6, output the 6th term of the finonacci sequence).
 This took me a while, but then he asked me if I knew what recursive functions
 were.
 I did, but it did take a little bit of time for me to get the right answer.
 I was able to come up with something that worked.

 Talked about US quarterly GDP data and how I would got about fitting an
 AR(1) model.
 I said that the data needs to be stationary in order for us to fit a time
 series model, the AR(1).
 After obtaining stationarity, we would use OLS to get the coefficients
 and get the model.
 This took a while to but I was able to eventually solve it.

\begin_layout Standard
Here is from another interview: His questions concentrated on 
\series bold
Time Series analysis, R, Packages of R
\series default
, and Maximum Likelihood Estimators, and OLS.
 Some of his questions were: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1)What can we say about the distribution of errors in a Ordinary Least Squares
 Regression? (I answered this correctly, that errors need to be independent,
 and identically distributed to "cancel" each other out, and thus produce
 optimal results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2)If you have two time series with different frequencies (i.e.
 DGP (quarterly) vs.
 Unemployment (Monthly), how do you regress them? (I answer correctly that
 we need to regress the less frequent data - such as GDP (quarterly) to
 interpolate and produce a more granular series.
 However you need to take into account any trend, seasonality effects embedded
 in the time series to make the appropriate regression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3)He asked a question related to the drift term in any time series.
 I answered that in general, we need to "demean" the series so as to make
 it stationary as a general prerequisite for any valid time series analysis.
 The reason being that the any trend, or seasonality, or drift will obscure
 the volatility embedded in the series, thus rendering the analysis less
 than optimal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4)In an Auto-regressive Moving Average Process, do you look at the Auto-correlat
ion Function (ACF) or the Partial Auto-correlation Function (PACF), and
 why? (I answered this correctly, as I explained that the (ACF) of an Auto-regre
ssive process tails off after lag p, whereas a PACF cuts off after lag p.
 I was going to mention the same conditions for a moving average process,
 but the cut me off.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5)For an auto-regressive process of order p=1, can we perform OLS estimators
 by regressing the series on itself at a specific time lag? (I answered
 this incorrectly, as I answered yes).
 This has to do with the residuals.
 Overall, I liked that he explained the culture of the bank, the acquisitions
 made, and their values.

50% of time is to develop and maintain loss forecasting models for credit

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
50% of time is to sell our models to Internal customers (marketing / finance).
 That turns out an equally interesting part as building the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our customers are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Largest customer is Marketing: when they need to design some new product,
 or new campaign, they have to come to us to let us run the product through
 our forecasting, to see whether they can make money.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
They have strong incentive to question our model accuracy, but only when
 our forecasting loss is too high and kills their product.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It can take care both loss and revenue.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Normally a loss forecasting model can only forecast loss and has nothing
 to do with revenue, which restrains the usage of the model.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Traditional model can only start from the very beginning of the loan, this
 model can start from any mob.

\begin_layout Itemize
Also this is the account level model, so you can group whatever way you
 want.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model: One Single Model for Multi-Purposes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why one model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So you see we have multiple customers: marketing, Treasury and Finance.
 So we have to build the forecasting model that is 
\series bold
Generic and Flexible enough
\series default
 that can serve those customers' need at the same time.
 We don't want to build separate models just to serve separate customers
 and different proposes, because essentially they have the same purposes:
 measure the risk of a product under different scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, Revenue and Loss shall naturally connected and modeled within one
 framework.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Thy practice to biuld a model to forecast revenue and then biuld a model
 to forecast loss separately is flawed and redudent.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
So what we are trying to do now, is to build one single loss forecasting
 model for a product, and that model has enough 
\series bold
flexibility and scalability
\series default
 that can extent itself to model the loss at Campaign level, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
offer level, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
then all the way up to the whole portfolio level, which can be used for
 stress testing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise: have multiple models for that product: we have one model to decide
 the potential loss of a campaign, we have another model for collection,
 then we have another model for regulators, like stress testing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AND to maintain those models turns out a huge 
\series bold
burden
\series default
 to a middle-size bank like us.

\begin_layout Standard
In our bank we have a monthly meeting to decide to what kind of campaign
 we want to launc, and I need to provide a loss forecasting for this campaign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If my loss forecasting is too high, and their campaign can not pass the
 Profit hurdle and so they cannot mail the campaign, so often they first
 come to us to argue the forecasting is way to high
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Be 
\series bold

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
consistent
\series default
 : We also try our best to keep our loss forecasting 
\series bold
consistent
\series default
, so they can have a clear expectation of what offer will pass the profit
 hurdle, what will not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
So everytime before we run the forecasting, we have to talk to them and
 really understand what they 
\series bold
expect.
 
\series default
We don't want to give them a surprise.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Be Proactive:
\series default
 Whenever we made saw some differences in forecasting, I don't wait them
 to come to me, I try to be active to, to talk to them first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Go further: make the model accessible to everyone.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is a huge change of our role: originally we are so 
\series bold
obsessed
\series default
 with the modelling and just though out the output to our business partners,
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we are trying to make the model as a

\series bold
a product that is easy to be used by everyone
\series default
.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
So in this way, we build a very good working relationship.
 We still have tensions, because Credit Risk and Marketing are naturally
 having opposite interest: we want to control and they want to expand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
But by being more active, more consistent, and communicating more, we worked
 really well.

 But they user and consumer of the model, don't even have access to the

there are so many dynamics in shape of the curve, how high the peak is,

\begin_layout Enumerate
Also As this product just launced in 2013, we don't have data for the late

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Especially this product launched since 2013, so at that time we didn't have

\begin_layout Enumerate
Also accounts with different FICO or in different loan terms shall naturally
 have different shapes of the curve.

\begin_layout Standard

Solution

\begin_layout Itemize
The way we solve this problem is, we will not 
\series bold
try forecast the whole life of the product at once
\series default
, instead, we biuld a model to forecast only one month ahead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Once we got the forecasted next month status, we plug in this forecasted
 result into our model again, to forecast the Next Next Month.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
PD and payment are not separated things.
 They are interactive with each other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If a customer keeps making the early payment, then his EAD is low, PD is
 also low.
 --- Thus PD, and Payment -- 
\series bold
They shall be incorporated in the one forecasting system.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The way we are doing this is, we create multiple equations and each equation
 just described one single kind of behavior.
 We got one equation to forecast deliqnuency, another one to forecast early
 payment.
 When we use them, we link them together.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
We first run all the accounts through the delinquency equation, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then if the account is not predicted to be delinquent,
\series bold
 given that predicted information
\series default
, we plug it in the second equation to predict early payment.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Because you know the initial balance at time 0, now you also know their
 payment at T, you can easily get the balance at T (which is your EAD)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
So each time, we just focus on one kind of behavior, then predict it, then
 utilize the updated information to predict another kind of behavior
\end_layout

After going through all thouse equations, we get full information for an
 accoutn at T: then plug the result into these system again to predict T+1

\begin_layout Itemize
For credit card model, my job is to maintain it and improve it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Originally it was purely excel-based and required a lot manual effort when
 you want to use the model.
 There are 
\series bold
v-loop up
\series default
, 
\series bold
update pivot table
\series default
, 
\series bold
VBA
\series default
 and 
\series bold

\SpecialChar \ldots{}
..
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bascially it is to smooth the historical performance for each kind of offer.
 Then acoording to the campaign request, we do a weighted average of different
 curves of different offers to generate overall campaign curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Excel is 
\series bold
best for some simple and stable model
\series default
, but when things become complex and you keep adding new features into it,
 it is very easy to break down and become un-maintainable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We have a 3-page long document to explain
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
what shall do,

\begin_layout Itemize
what you shall watch out, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
what you might be missing when you use model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So it normally requires 30 minutes to generate one single curve 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So after I took over the job I completely re-wrote the whole thing using

\series default
 for credit card 
\series bold
product --- 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When you apply our card, whether we want to approve your application, based
 on your FICO score, income, debt, mortgage, past payment behavior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then we need to decide how much credit limit we want to give you, whether
 it is 1000 or 10000, 
\series bold
the idea is
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
We want to give you enough line to 
\series bold
Encourage
\series default
 you to do more spending and carry more balances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But we don't want to you too much otherwise if you didnt pay back to us,
 we will lose a lot
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
We also do lot of marketing stuff -- our goal is to optimize the the total
 profit of a campaign
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So we need to carefully design the credit card offers to balance the response
 rate and profit margin.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I also spent a lot time interacting with marketing, operational or IT people.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
listen to their ideas 
\series bold
when we design
\series default
 the strategy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
get to their feedback 
\series bold
when we implement
\series default
 this strategy.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
So you see this kind of job really helps you understand the business, understand
 the product, because everything you did defines the features of a product,
 and would have a direct impact on customers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
CLI Optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first do the segmentation of customers based on their behavior and risk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For example, if a customer just uses our card for gas and grocery and restaurant
, and payback in full every month, then he didn't need the line increase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But if the customer keeps 90% balance in our card all the time, that means
 an incremental increase of his limit will
\series bold
 induce
\series default
 him to carry on more balances on us, so incrementally, we make more money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Project: Marketing Campaign
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Background
\series default
: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
everymonth we send out direct mails, emails to certain group of potential
 customers to invite them to apply our credit cards.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The key metric of this campaign is the 
\series bold
respons rate,
\series default
 (which is 
\series bold
quite similar with Converstion Rate
\series default
).
 But 
\series bold
for us this is not the whole story
\series default
, the metric we truely cares is about how much money we can make per customers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So there are two 
\series bold
dynamics / trade offs 
\series default
there
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
What 
\series bold
risk segment 
\series default
of customers you want to target.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
if you target the high risk customers, like 
\series bold
low FICO & low Inocme
\series default
, the response rate is high, but loss is high also, because they need the
 liquidity.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
how good the promotion should be.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
if the offer is too good, for example Huge Reward if you open the card,
 0 APR for 12m, etc.
 profit margin will shrink.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So we have to balance the 
\series bold
overall response rate and profitability of each responders.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So our job there is 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
carefully evaluate the risk dimention of customers, define how deep we want
 to go to the 
\series bold
subprime marke
\series default
t, ----- RA ROI

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Define good time ROI using the recent data
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Bad time ROI using the crisis historical data.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
and also to tweek the offer keep thr reponse rate same, and at the same
 time keep our profit margin high.
 ------- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
either by boosting the response rate or boosting the profitbility, but you
 can never get both.
\end_layout

\end_deeper

\begin_layout Subsection
Project: Minimum Critera
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minimum criteria for a campaign: ROE / ROI in good time and bad time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A/B test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So every month we send out credit card offers by direct mail or email, to
 invite them to apply our cards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are multiple factors of a campaign
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pricing: rewards, intro APR, go to APR, whether there is balance transfer
 fee.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Channel: online, email.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pre-approval or Invitation to Apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So my job there is how to design the offer/criteria to boost the response
 rate, For example, subprime customers really love the low intro-APR or
 balance transfer-offers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
but we don't want to make the offer too rich otherwise we will lose money,
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
also we dont want to target those super high risk customers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
because we have some minmum investment hurdle we have to meet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So these are the tricks we found that we can make more money per customer
 but not lose the response rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
A/B test: Tweak the Offer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if offer / pricing schedual can increase our profit margin
 5 percent, but drop the response rate by 1 percent, then this offer is
 good for us.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So we need catrefully measure the elasticity to the profitability and elasticity
 to response rate at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So our goal is there is to tweak the offer to make it looks like good, but
 actually not that good.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
one thing we find there that the customers are not really sensitive the
 go-to-APR, which means if you increase your go-to APR from 18% to 22%,
 the response rate didn't drop too much.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also customers are not that customers are not that sensitive to the duration
 of intro APR, which means if you shorten your intro-APR from 18m to 11m,
 response rate didn't change much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Response rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\times$
\end_inset

 profit per responders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First step of the optimization is to find the right offer to the right custome,
 which means we need to segment customers on their behavior and their risk.
 So it is a two-dimention matrix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A lot of debt: then we want to give them a balance transfer offer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Travel a lot: credit card with airline points.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Second step is find the best pricing for each group of the customer.
 We just plug in different pricing shcedual into the model to simulate the
 ROI under different pricing.
 Then you choose 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
ROI model is combination of models: it contains response rate model, then
 default probability model.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Then we run the simulation through our forecasting model to see how the
 ROI moves with the pricing of the offer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adverse Selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two perspectives in the Adverse Selection problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Risk Perspective: when the offer is bad
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Observable Information: Accept inferior offers have inferior observable
 characteristics; and the customers who accept inferior offers experience
 more defaults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hidden Information: even controlling other risk factors
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The pool of consumers who accept an offer displays inferior characteristics
 as compared to the pool of consumers who reject an offer, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The pool of consumers who accept an inferior contract exhibits inferior
 characteristics as compared to the pool of consumers who accept a better
 offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These coefficients can be interpreted as saying that, even after controlling
 for all information known to the card issuer at the time that the account
 is opened, respondents to a solicitation with an introductory interest
 rate 1 percent higher have a delinquency probability that is 1.2 percentage
 points higher, while respondents to a solicitation with an introductory
 offer which lasts 3 months longer have a delinquency probability that is
 1.7 percentage points lower.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Marketing Perspective: when the offer is too good
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adverse Selection on gamers/shoppers (not necessarily risky customers):
 since the data set continues to track customers after the end of the introducto
ry period, it allows us to examine consumers who switch once are more likely
 to switch a second time.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Then after controlling for all observable information, respondents to a
 solicitation with an introductory interest rate that is 1% lower have an
 activity probability that is 2.6% lower (i.e., an attrition probability that
 is 2.6% higher).
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Project: Inactive Closure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The longer the card stays inactive, 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the less probability it will be come active.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And when it became active, it became more and more riskier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We call them timing bomb, because if an economic crisis happens, those guys
 might suddenly use our card and charge-off.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
But you don't want to close them too early, because if they become active,
 you still have the chance of making money from them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So the optimal closure for an account is to evaluate marginal cost = marginal
 benefit of maintaining them
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Marginal cost is maintaining an account one more month.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Marginal benefit is all the expected profit when it becomes active multiply
 the probability of becoming active next month.
 Note that the profit might be negative even.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
And the dynamics of MC and MR changes as the account remains in inactive
 longer and longer.
 So by applying this simple economic ideas to this problem, we find a way
 to identify the optimal points of closing an account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Conclusion: we apply our method to different customers in different risk
 groups, find different optimal closure points for them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Product: Consistency of risk policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Example
\series default
: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
one customer can get a marketing offer from us and then suddenly get a line
 decrease, simply because these two strategies did not talk to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We group all of our actions into two groups: positive actions and negative
 actions, and we re-design all of our strategies to make sure that a customer
 who gets positive action from us will not receive a negative action within
 three months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
This idea is to insure consistency and clearness when you do actions on
 customers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This idea may sound like simple and natural but we didn't realize until
 2012.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So we decided to group customers to LOW, MEDIUM/LOW, MH, HIGH.
 Positive actions only happen in LOW and ML, negative actions only happen
 in HIGH.
 For Medium High, we leave it as grey area and has no action on it, neither
 positive or negative actions.
 So that we create a 
\series bold
grey area between good customers and bad customers, even if they migrate,
 it is hard for them to migrate directly from ML to H.

A lot of times you want to extract THE variables you are using in a formula,
 for example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Y = X + X‸2

\begin_layout Standard
Then depend on what's your background and the empirical context, there are

One: there is two variables there: X and X‸2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second: there is only one variable: X
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of empirical economist tend to think there is only one variable there,

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
A more Complex Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Normally we use both the level form of U and the squared form of it.
 So you want to insure that the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that the

Introductory offer: either BT / Purchasing / One--time reward
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
What is BT-fee, what is the duration of the introductory-offer 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The goal of the introductory offer is to seduce customers to respond to
 your campaign (either direct mail / in-branch / email).
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Portfolio Offer: after acquisition, to maintain the customer or complete
 in the WALLET SHARE 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Transaction-level offer: which is mainly Reward
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It is costly to the bank 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The purpose of reward is to seduce customers to use our card, and hopefully
 they 
\series bold
cannot
\series default
 fully payback in each cycle, and thus 
\series bold
turn them from translator to revolvers
\series default
.
 Thus we can charge them high APR

\begin_layout Standard
Go-To rate.
 This is the APR we talk about often.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I found customers are not very sensitive to go to rate, at least not as
 sensitive to Intro-offers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We measure sensitivity using 
\series bold
response rate\SpecialChar \ldots{}
.

\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So one tactic we use is to give Super good Intro-offer to seduce customers
 open the card and build balance.
 And then charge them high go-to APR.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is super hard to have a closed-form equation that can optimize every
 aspect of pricing, because there are so many factors complicate things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Pricing is just not APR,
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
it has Intro / Reward \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 It has BT/Purchasing \SpecialChar \ldots{}
.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Pricing is 
\series bold
not an One Stage thing
\series default
, it 
\series bold
is not decided in the acquisition level
\series default
 
\series bold
along
\series default
 and never change, because when you book the account, (booking is costly)
 you have to maintain the account, (attached rather than detached)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So you have to take care of pricing of any 
\series bold
portfolio management offer, rather than just acquisition level
\series default
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Pricing cannot simply be based on risk.
 Because through 
\series bold
Adverse Selection
\series default
, pricing on the other hand can affect the risk.
 We cannot simply adjust the pricing proportionally according to FICO or
 other risk factor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Even if you found the perfect pricing where you can optimize your profit
 on each single card member, this does not mean it is an optimization for
 
\series bold
overall profit
\series default
.
 The overall profit = Profit for each responder MULTIPLY by number of responders.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So you really want to 
\series bold
release some profit to customers by lowering the price to get more competitive
 and get more responders.

\series default
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Customers are never homogenous, there are translators /revolvers.
 There are smart customers that shop different cards for rich intro-offers.
 There are loyal customers who are so conservative and just use your card.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So you want to design offers for each of the single type of the customer.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If there is a possible way to attach this problem, you want to design a
 model for each of the single aspect of the pricing, and link the model
 together.
 Then simulate the results through this 
\series bold
system of models to get the optimized pricing.

The investment industry defines risk as variance, or uncertainty of profit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumer banking industry define risks as probability of loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we buy stocks we take some 
\series bold
Idiosyncratic
\series default
 risk, because we only certain amount of stocks and we didn't diversity
 enough.
 So there is uncertainty there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when we make loans, for each risk group we have hundreds of thousands
 of customers, so by law of large number our return will converge to average
 return of that risk group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the only risk we are taking is systematic risk, the risk that caused
 by the fluctuation of macro economy and will affect every single customer
 at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are willing to take this risk because
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They are un-diversifiable 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They are the only risk that can give you reward.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Idiosyncratic risk is the risk that gives you nothing, as they are diversifiable.

The only purpose of this team is to build models for regulators, and those
 models will not be used elsewhere in the business, correct?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So do you think, if regulators don't require us to do these kind modeling,
 will we still do this modeling for ourselves.

The ultimate goal for any modeling team is to develop robust and flexible
 models that can last long.
 One the model was developed, the rest of part is just daily routine, is
 just to maintain the model and use the model

How if someone did not buy your model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not because your model is not robust or sounded, just because they don't
 like the result of your model, for example, your forecasting may suggest
 a completely opposite story that the management committee believe.
