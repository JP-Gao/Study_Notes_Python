:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She asked normal personality / stress questions.
 Describe a problem you had with a project mate or co-worker would be the
 hardest of those.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She asked me 4 quantitative questions: I felt really uncomfortable doing
 math over the phone.
 I'll work on that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q1: Roll a 6 sided dice and you get the face value of the dice.
 What is your willingness to pay.
 I added incorrectly at first, rookie mistake.
 The answer was 3.5 -- the expected value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q2: Same game as Q1 but you have the option for a second roll if the first
 roll does not provide a satisfactory result.
 My brain was stuck.
 I eventually got the right answer.
 I kept getting 8.5, but I forgot to divide by 2.
 I realized my error without help and eventually answered that correctly.
 I had to talk out the problem to figure out what I was doing wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Q3: There are 25 horses and you need to find the fastest three horses, but
 you can only race 5 horses at once.
 I got this wrong.
 I got 9.
 She said the answer was 7.
 I'll find my error after I finish this e-mail.
\end_layout

Q4: In a multiple Regression what are the assumptions?

FIRST REPUBLIC INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1-Thanks for setting up the call.
 I spoke with 
\series bold
Sam
\series default
 yesterday and the conversation went pretty well.
 He asked questions about my background, what I do in my current role, how
 I would handle large data sets/doing calculations in Excel, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He asked if I knew VLOOKUP (I said I did, and I use INDEX-MATCH instead,
 which he was impressed with).
 He told me about the company and what areas he manages, and he asked what
 I was looking for in a role--if I'd be ok with preparing reports for senior
 management, or working on data-intensive projects for a few months at a
 time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He also asked about R and what I've done with it so far.
 He also asked me if I knew what a CUSIP was (I do), and he asked me if
 I knew what the duration of a bond was (I do).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He asked what impact does the duration have/what does it mean/what does
 it represent.
 This one I sort of stumbled with because the question wasn't all that clear.
 He was essentially asking to see if I knew that when the yield of the bond
 goes up, the price of the bond goes down, and vice versa.
 Also, longer duration bonds will generally have a higher yield than shorter
 duration bonds, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2-Basically most of the interview started with going over the resume in
 details, then questions like the following: In sum, they asked me tons
 of technical questions - ranging from basic compound interest problems
 (Sam) to spurious regressions in R (Eugene).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I answered about 80 percent of the questions correctly, and I solved about
 10 percent more with the hints they gave me (partial help).
 Moreover, I could not solve various problems including a combinatorics
 problem (Atanas) dealing with horses in a racetrack, and a factorial problem
 (related to 47 factorial) that Eugene gave me.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The questions 
\series bold
Eric
\series default
 asked were not too hard, although some did take me a while to get the answer.
 He first started out by asking me to go through my resume, which I did,
 but we stopped before we got to the project section of my resume.
 Here are some questions he asked me to test my knowledge: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 What are forwards and futures and the difference between them? I got the
 first part right in that one party agree to pay a certain price for a product
 or service to the other party at a specified date in the future.
 Unfortunately, I messed up when I got future and options confused, but
 he quickly pointed out to me this mistake, so I proceeded to tell him that
 one difference was the futures can be traded with other parties.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this part, we moved to other questions.
 In hindsight, I should have said more about their differences, such as
 futures are exchange traded and forwards are not, forwards are more customized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 What is CAPM? I felt that I answered this well, in that we need the risk
 free rate, market returns, and beta (market risk exposure) to calculate
 what the rate of return should be on a given stock.
 I did not give him the formula to calculate it though, so I do not know
 if that is a problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Asked what k-means clustering is but I did not know that, but I did know
 what k nearest neighbor is, which is similar to k-means clustering, and
 explained that to him.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 write pseudo-code to obtain the n-th term of the fibonacci numbers(eg if
 n=6, output the 6th term of the finonacci sequence).
 This took me a while, but then he asked me if I knew what recursive functions
 were.
 I did, but it did take a little bit of time for me to get the right answer.
 I was able to come up with something that worked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Talked about US quarterly GDP data and how I would got about fitting an
 AR(1) model.
 I said that the data needs to be stationary in order for us to fit a time
 series model, the AR(1).
 After obtaining stationarity, we would use OLS to get the coefficients
 and get the model.
 This took a while to but I was able to eventually solve it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Basic SQL questions: what is the difference between Having and Where clause,
 and What is the difference between inner join and left join.
 I was able to answer these without any help from Eric.
 For the final part of the interview, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I got to ask him some questions.
 I asked him what some of the projects they were working on and some other
 work his team did.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is from another interview: His questions concentrated on 
\series bold
Time Series analysis, R, Packages of R
\series default
, and Maximum Likelihood Estimators, and OLS.
 Some of his questions were: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1)What can we say about the distribution of errors in a Ordinary Least Squares
 Regression? (I answered this correctly, that errors need to be independent,
 and identically distributed to "cancel" each other out, and thus produce
 optimal results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2)If you have two time series with different frequencies (i.e.
 DGP (quarterly) vs.
 Unemployment (Monthly), how do you regress them? (I answer correctly that
 we need to regress the less frequent data - such as GDP (quarterly) to
 interpolate and produce a more granular series.
 However you need to take into account any trend, seasonality effects embedded
 in the time series to make the appropriate regression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3)He asked a question related to the drift term in any time series.
 I answered that in general, we need to "demean" the series so as to make
 it stationary as a general prerequisite for any valid time series analysis.
 The reason being that the any trend, or seasonality, or drift will obscure
 the volatility embedded in the series, thus rendering the analysis less
 than optimal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4)In an Auto-regressive Moving Average Process, do you look at the Auto-correlat
ion Function (ACF) or the Partial Auto-correlation Function (PACF), and
 why? (I answered this correctly, as I explained that the (ACF) of an Auto-regre
ssive process tails off after lag p, whereas a PACF cuts off after lag p.
 I was going to mention the same conditions for a moving average process,
 but the cut me off.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5)For an auto-regressive process of order p=1, can we perform OLS estimators
 by regressing the series on itself at a specific time lag? (I answered
 this incorrectly, as I answered yes).
 This has to do with the residuals.
 Overall, I liked that he explained the culture of the bank, the acquisitions
 made, and their values.
