Q & A
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to cluster users in social media
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Model
\series default
: Normally use two algorithms to do clustering: K-means & Gaussian Mixture
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
K-means is to assign a hard label
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Gaussian Mixture is to assign a soft label, which give you a a probability
 of being A or B
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Multiple Tags
\series default
: But the problem is, those models will give you mutually exclusive labels
 : 
\series bold
IN REALITY
\series default
 one user may have 
\series bold
multiple tags
\series default
 / labels at the same.
 One user may love music and computer science at the same time
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
So there is no way to do clustering at just one time
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You need to first choose music related featuresm, do clustering on whether
 a user likes music or not.
 Then run another clustering to decide for the computer science label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
That means, for each time, you just model one label.
 But you run the label multiple times to get all the labels you want.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Hierarchy
\series default
: Also even within the music label, there are further sublabels --- rock,
 pop, rap etc.
 So you have to run clustering in a hierarchical way.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I means first decide all the pepople who like music, then within those people,
 clustering into different groups
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Features used to cluster in social media
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Facebook: Two dimentions
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
based on their interests / Base on what they write on their wall: You can
 extract key words / topics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
also interest of the people are following / What those followees write on
 their wall.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Twitter:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Based on what they tweet, y
\series default
ou can use 
\series bold
extract certain key toptics, key words.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Based on who they follow
\series default
: It's hard to directly do clustering on common users.
 But it is relatively easy to cluster those celebrities, they are most likely
 just has oen label --- either movie star, musician, or comupter scientist.
 So their labels are more 
\series bold
pure 
\series default
that common users.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Then we go back to the common users, to see what types of celebrities they
 follow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Or we can even bring the number of likes or retweets for each celebrities,
 using this as a weight to mearue how strong / close this following relation
 is.
 So the following relation is no longer 0 or 1 anymore, it may be 0, 1,
 2, continous integers.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Data can be constructed like this: It is a matrix with rows as users, columns
 as celebrities.
 value equal to 1 if a user follow a celebrity, equal to 0 if not.
 OR the value is the total ``

Why an advertiser becomes inactive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model wise: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feature: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
industry: you want to indenify which industry likes do marketing on Twitter,
 which not like.
 Those are the markets we need to penetrate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Cost per click / view.
 ---- to see whether the advertiser is really price sensitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
how many times they do campaign on twitter --- 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
new advertisers may have a high churn rate.
 So you have to design retention strategies specificly for them
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
old users tend to stay very long time, but once they become inactive, that
 means something bad happends, we may want to call them to figure out why.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
How much money spend on Twitter in total.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How much time the advertise spend on the campaign designing page ---- they
 may feel frustration on figuring out how to design their campaign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why a User becomes inactive
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Logit
\series default
: Biulding model here is easy, logistic regression would work here.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Interpreation
\series default
: becasue the purpose of model is
\series bold
 not only prediction, but also interpreation
\series default
.
 Because we want to understand which variable causes the inactivity.
 So you really want to use some glassbox model rather than black box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Probability
\series default
: Also when you want to classify 0,1, you want something can give you a
 probability, rather than just give you 0 or 1
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Then you can use these probability to design some action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Action Plan
\series default
: For example, if we forsee a high value customer will become inactive,
 then you want to call him, or give him better offers.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Feature
\series default
: Finding out the exact correct features is the key.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Feature: interest they have, number of people they follow, number of people
 that follows him, demographic etc.

Understanding Ad Engagement Behavior of High Net Worth user
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Give me a context of this problem, or what problems we are trying to solve
 here
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Answer: I'm not sure the exact engagement pattern of those high net-value
 people, But if I see the data, the data can reveal their pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I want to use the data to test: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
What 
\series bold
kind of ads
\series default
 they are particular interest
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In average, how they will 
\series bold
interact
\series default
 with the adds, whether he will spend some seconds to view it, or even reply
 it and click into it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
what is the 
\series bold
difference in conversion rat
\series default
e: They are probably esiser to do impusive purchases, especially for high
 price stuff.
 So if you target them with the purpose of conversion rate, they are probably
 higher than normal people

\begin_layout Subsection
Pagerank to measure importance/influence of user
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The importance of a user depends on number of followers, and also depend
 on the importance of those followers.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If an influential celebrity A follows B, then B must also has certain importance.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Pagerank algorithm is using this idea to measure how importance/influence
 of a point in the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way it works is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Image you want to do a random work through all the social network, starting
 from point A, as A is following N people the probability that A travels
 to each followees 1/N.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then assume now we travel from A to B, then do a random walk to the people
 that B follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You keep doing one millions of time, and it turned out the probability/number
 of times of getting to a certain point will converge to a steady value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
That value is the score of the importance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the idea is: if the more people follow a point A, then it is easier to get
 their.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Path Find to measure importance of a user
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can think about this problem as a path finding problem: How to find
 the shortest parth to travel from one user to another user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you randomly select two points in the scoial network, both A and B have
 no common firends in the real world, but they both follow one musician
 in Twitter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You do this test millions times --- each time you randomly select two points
 and calculating the clost path.
 The more common trespassing / transiting points are those celebrities.

\begin_layout Itemize
In the pre-data-science period, statistician interviewers were composed
 of at least
\series bold
 half internal data customers from various domains.

\series default
 They wanted to know
\series bold
 how I can help them achieve their research or business goals with data.

\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In contrast, all of my data scientist interviewers (not just at Twitter)
 were younger and more computing savvy data analysts from quantitative backgroun
d.
 They wanted to know if I know how to do xyz, where xyz is something they
 themselves have encountered.
 This difference is important for candidate and employers of data scientist.

\begin_layout Section
Twitter Products
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of this falls under the line of two of the most important use cases
 that we want to focus on, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
News.
 And we think Twitter is better at real-time news and live news than anyone
 else on the platform – in the world, I should say.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Social commentary.
 Anyone can comment about what's happening now and share their thoughts,
 and sometimes those go into conversation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, that's what we want to make stronger and also easier.
 So, four areas that we've been focused on there.
 Number one is around on-boarding.
 We've been applying a lot more machine learning and deep learning to our
 on-boarding, so we can match people faster to their interests.
 And we believe that that interest drive is really important to us and unique
 to us.
 Two, is the timeline where people spend the majority of their time.
 We've made a number of refinements over the past few months to make sure
 that we're showing what's most important and what really matters, and enabling
 people to quickly get back to everything and to recency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notifications is another area where we think we can do a much better job,
 especially around breaking news.
 And not that we just push you into a tweet that dead ends, but we can enable
 you to further explore topics around that tweet and that interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Periscope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interest of Users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those logged-in users explicitly express their interests, what they care
 about, if they're a Red Sox fan, if they're a Jets fan, if they're Republican
 or Democrat, based on who they're following.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Moments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The real question is what value casual, lapsed, and non-users of Twitter
 will find in Moments — and that’s much harder to answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their bias is toward tweets from the source: people who are on the scene,
 or are directly involved in the news story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What we try to do is just immerse you in the content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it sounds like Twitter is now running a media company inside a technology
 company, that’s because it is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One aspect of Moments I didn’t see coming: not every story captures a real-time
 event.
 The company is also packaging together evergreen stories ("Catch a wave,"

Advertising inventory is the number of advertisements, or amount of ad space,
 a publisher has available to sell to an advertiser.
 Ad inventory is often calculated by the month.
 The term can refer to ads in print or other traditional media but is increasing
ly used to refer to online or mobile ads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes.
 So, on the online budgets, these are a set of budgets that we don’t have
 exposure to today, because they require a certain set of features that
 we are working on right now.
 These are features like demographic targeting and validation, GRP and TRP,
 targeting and reporting.
 So, it’s a function of putting these features in place.
 We believe that we can tap into incremental video budgets when we put those
 features in place.

\begin_layout Standard
DoubleClick deal.
 DCM as you mentioned, which is around measurement.
 And DBM, which is around ad buying.
 So let me start with the DCM piece measurement.
 In the quarter, we expanded the beta over a dozen advertisers and we have
 run hundreds of campaigns now through DCM.
 We have seen two things.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One, when measuring desktop impressions to desktop conversions, the data
 looks accurate through DCM and the results for Twitter for these campaigns
 looks strong.
 So that’s good news.
 When on the other edge – on the other side of the house, when you look
 at mobile impressions that are measured through DCM that are measuring
 desktop conversions, so this cross-device measurement, what we saw through
 the measurement period is that something that the industry overall needs
 to address which is that this type of cross-device measurement overall
 need to work from an industry standpoint.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is something that we are working with Google together on.
 It’s part of the reasons why we did the DoubleClick deal in the first place
 is to help solve some of this cross-device measurement for the overall
 industry.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This hits us particularly in an acute way because 90% of our impressions,
 our ad impressions are on mobile.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So cross-device for us is really important part.
 On the DBM side, Google engineers and Twitter engineers are working on
 the buying piece for integration.
 We believe it will be in beta in Q3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the SMB side, we were up on a year-on-year basis overall in active advertiser
s and it was driven by our SMB initiatives.
 SMB for us is an exciting opportunity because we have identified close
 to 9 million businesses who have setup shop on Twitter and are using it
 organically.
 Our goal is to move those 9 million businesses through the funnel to become
 active advertisers on the platform.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we look at our top 10 vertical categories, QSR, quick serve restaurants,
 as well as retail were two categories that performed decidedly lower than
 the rest of the overall business, which are macro driven categories.

you have a table where you have date, user_id, song_id and count.
 It shows at the end of each day how many times in her history a user has
 listened to a given song.
 So count is cumulative sum.
 You have to update this on a daily basis based on a second table that records
 in real time when a user listens to a given song.
 Basically, at the end of each day, you go to this second table and pull
 a count of each user/song combination and then add this count to the first
 table that has the lifetime count.
 If it is the first time a user has listened to a given song, you won't
 have this pair in the lifetime table, so you have to create the pair there
 and then add the count of the last day.

I had a great experience leading up to my 2nd of 2 phone interviews, which
 was clearly the turning point in my overall interview experience.
 The guy was a little arrogant and not prepared, asking the same questions
 as the previous interviewer and mumbling/speaking in an unclear manner.
 I did my best to recap his questions, which he rattled off in a jumbled

 changing various input drivers.
 Next we walked through an old expense forecasting model the company used
 to use, and I was asked to simply talk about some of the ways the model
 could be improved.

\begin_layout Itemize
50% of time is to develop and maintain loss forecasting models for credit
 card and Personal loans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
50% of time is to sell our models to Internal customers (marketing / finance).
 That turns out an equally interesting part as building the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our customers are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Largest customer is Marketing: when they need to design some new product,
 or new campaign, they have to come to us to let us run the product through
 our forecasting, to see whether they can make money.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
They have strong incentive to question our model accuracy, but only when
 our forecasting loss is too high and kills their product.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize
Finance: loss reserve calculation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the model developing part, I recently redeveloped the whole personal

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The structure of the model is flexible enough to be adapted to Mortgage
 and auto-loan.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It can take care both loss and revenue.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Normally a loss forecasting model can only forecast loss and has nothing
 to do with revenue, which restrains the usage of the model.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Traditional model can only start from the very beginning of the loan, this
 model can start from any mob.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also this is the account level model, so you can group whatever way you
 want.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Model: One Single Model for Multi-Purposes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why one model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So you see we have multiple customers: marketing, Treasury and Finance.
 So we have to build the forecasting model that is 
\series bold
Generic and Flexible enough
\series default
 that can serve those customers' need at the same time.
 We don't want to build separate models just to serve separate customers
 and different proposes, because essentially they have the same purposes:
 measure the risk of a product under different scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Also, Revenue and Loss shall naturally connected and modeled within one
 framework.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Thy practice to biuld a model to forecast revenue and then biuld a model
 to forecast loss separately is flawed and redudent.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
So what we are trying to do now, is to build one single loss forecasting
 model for a product, and that model has enough 
\series bold
flexibility and scalability
\series default
 that can extent itself to model the loss at Campaign level, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
offer level, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
then all the way up to the whole portfolio level, which can be used for
 stress testing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise: have multiple models for that product: we have one model to decide
 the potential loss of a campaign, we have another model for collection,
 then we have another model for regulators, like stress testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AND to maintain those models turns out a huge 
\series bold
burden
\series default
 to a middle-size bank like us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Behavior: Team work Experience: work with marketing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example to work with marketing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our bank we have a monthly meeting to decide to whether mail a campaign,
 and I need to provide a loss forecasting for this campaign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If my loss forecasting is too high, and their campaign can not pass the
 Profit hurdle and so they cannot mail the campaign, so often they first
 come to us to argue the forecasting is way to high
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Be 
\series bold
Patient
\series default
, because they don't know your model at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
consistent
\series default
 : We also try our best to keep our loss forecasting 
\series bold
consistent
\series default
, so they can have a clear expectation of what offer will pass the profit
 hurdle, what will not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
So everytime before we run the forecasting, we have to talk to them and
 really understand what they 
\series bold
expect.
 
\series default
We don't want to give them a surprise.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Be Proactive:
\series default
 Whenever we made saw some differences in forecasting, I don't wait them
 to come to me, I try to be active to, to talk to them first.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Go further: make the model accessible to everyone.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is a huge change of our role: originally we are so obsessed with the
 modelling and just though out the output to our business partners, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we are trying to make the model as a 
\series bold
product
\series default
, 
\series bold
a product that is easy to be used by everyone
\series default
.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
So in this way, we build a very good working relationship.
 We still have tensions, because Credit Risk and Marketing are naturally
 having opposite interest: we want to control and they want to expand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
But by being more active, more consistent, and communicating more, we worked
 really well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Business: Serve Customer of Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Originally, our model is coded in R, and every time Marketing sends us the
 campaign they want to launch, we plug the characteristics of the campaign
 into our model and give the output back to marketing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem is, only we know how to play the model,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So to the marketing people, our model is a 
\series bold
black box
\series default
, or our whole risk department is a black box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But they user and consumer of the model, don't even have access to the model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The efficacy /ˈefəkəsē/ of your model does not only depend on the model
 itself, but on how the model users use the result your model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
So what I did there, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
instead of using the model for each campaign at one time and using the model
 only we know the campaign.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I summarized all the historical campaigns and find all possible combination,
 for example, different combinations of APR, fees, channels etc.
 In total there are hundreds of possible campaigns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Output the model's result into a pivot table in excel, with some dynamic
 graphs, where you can click the VBA button so that they can choose mix
 of offers, channels and segmentation and automatically see the loss curve
 and profit curve.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
So after this become a user tool, when marking design their offer, they
 will see the profitability and loss vividly

Background:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
There is a natural conflict between any marketing person and a risk person.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They have strong interests to question the accuracy of our loss curves,
 but only when it is so high to let their campaign fail in P&L evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They are non- technical people; they have no idea in 
\series bold

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EXAMPLE: sometimes you have to convince them one good performance campaign
 cannot represent anything, what we want to see is a continues good performance

\begin_layout Subsection
Model: UCL forecasting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
complications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ultimate goal is to build a model that can forecast loss curves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several features for this model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For each time, we just forecast one period ahead, then we plug in the predicted
 result into the model again to forecast one period further.
 First from to T to T+1, then based on predictions on T+1, we predict T+2.
 So we keep doing this kind of thing recursively till T+N.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a reason we design our model in this way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It is hard to find a closed form equation to generate a curve at once.
 When you are talking a loss curve, that is the loss dollar rate for 60
 months or even 72 months.
 It is hard to use a single equation to describe the shape of the curve,
 how high the peak is, when is the peak, what happens after the peak (should
 it stay high, or sharply decrease or slowly decrease).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Also accounts with different FICO or in different loan terms shall naturally
 have different shapes of the curve.
 When I mean different shapes I mean you cannot just adjust the curve proportion
ally to fit different risk groups.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Another feature of this model is, this model predicts every aspect of an
 account behaviors, including charge-off, delinquent, early payment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The way we are doing this is, we create multiple equations and each equation
 just described one single kind of behavior.
 When we use them, we link them together.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
For example, the first LOGIT equation to predict charge-off, then we simulate
 accounts through this equation,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
if the account is not predicted to be charged off, 
\series bold
then given that updated information
\series default
, we plug it in the second equation to predict delinquency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then third one is, 
\series bold
given they are not delinquent,
\series default
 whether they will do early pay, the fourth one is given they will do early
 pay, how much they will pay.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
So each time, we just focus on one kind of behavior, then predict it, then
 utilize the updated information to predict another kind of behavior
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reason is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The dollar loss rate is determined by the probability of charge off, but
 also determined by the charge off amount
\end_layout

Bascially it is to smooth the historical performance for each kind of offer.
 Then acoording to the campaign request, we do a weighted average of different
 curves of different offers to generate overall campaign curve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Excel is

 it is very easy to break down and become un-maintainable.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
For example, we do CLI: which line increase, so when we see a customer is

Also line decrease, authorization of contain transactions, especially when
 those transactions are over limit, or believed to be fraud.

Project: Marketing Campaign::: WEI YANG
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
how rich the offer should be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What segment of customers you want to target.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Background
\series default
: everymonth we send out direct mails, emails to certain group of customers
 to invite them to apply our credit cards.
 We tested different colors of letters, different APR or fees etc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The problem is: Makring department only cares about responds rate.
 BUT normally Marketing only cares response rate, so they have strong interest
 to go for the high risk customers and give them good offers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We, as risk department cares about the profitbility of the the campaign.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
But our risk team is really responsible to control the risk exposure of
 our portfolio.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So this is an OPTIMIZATION problem in which you have to really combine the
 
\series bold
response rate 
\series default
and

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So this is different from the online campaign for some Internet companies.
 They only have one-step problem -- book as many as customers as they can
 -We get a two-step problem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But we never achieve this global optimization, because different departments
 are deeply siloed.
 Instead, we just design some minimum risk criteria, and thus any campaign
 passed that criteria, we can send out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But the hard part is, this is not a one-step game, because if book too many
 customers this quarter, or this year, then next year naturally there are
 less customers to book.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Risk Perspective: when the offer is bad

\begin_layout Itemize
Observable Information: Accept inferior offers have inferior observable
 characteristics; and the customers who accept inferior offers experience
 more defaults.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hidden Information: even controlling other risk factors

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The pool of consumers who accept an offer displays inferior characteristics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The pool of consumers who accept an inferior contract exhibits inferior
 characteristics as compared to the pool of consumers who accept a better
 offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
These coefficients can be interpreted as saying that, even after controlling
 for all information known to the card issuer at the time that the account
 is opened, respondents to a solicitation with an introductory interest
 rate 1 percent higher have a delinquency probability that is 1.2 percentage
 points higher, while respondents to a solicitation with an introductory
 offer which lasts 3 months longer have a delinquency probability that is
 1.7 percentage points lower.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Marketing Perspective: when the offer is too good
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adverse Selection on gamers/shoppers (not necessarily risky customers):
 since the data set continues to track customers after the end of the introducto
ry period, it allows us to examine consumers who switch once are more likely
 to switch a second time.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Then after controlling for all observable information, respondents to a
 solicitation with an introductory interest rate that is 1% lower have an
 activity probability that is 2.6% lower (i.e., an attrition probability that
 is 2.6% higher).

\begin_layout Subsection
Project: Inactive Closure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The longer the card stays inactive, the less probability it will be come
 active.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And when it became active, it became more and more riskier.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
We call them timing bomb, because if an economic crisis happens, those guys
 might suddenly use our card and charge-off.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
But you don't want to close them too early, because if they become active,
 you still have the chance of making money from them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So the optimal closure for an account is to evaluate marginal cost = marginal
 benefit of maintaining them
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Marginal cost is maintaining an account one more month.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Marginal benefit is all the expected profit when it becomes active multiply
 the probability of becoming active next month.
 Note that the profit might be negative even.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
And the dynamics of MC and MR changes as the account remains in inactive
 longer and longer.
 So by applying this simple economic ideas to this problem, we find a way
 to identify the optimal points of closing an account.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conclusion: we apply our method to different customers in different risk
 groups, find different optimal closure points for them.

\begin_layout Subsection
Product: Consistency of risk policy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One big thing we did when I was there is,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We group all of our actions into two groups: positive actions and negative
 actions, and we re-design all of our strategies to make sure that a customer
 who gets positive action from us will not receive a negative action within
 three months.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
This idea is to insure consistency and clearness when you do actions on
 customers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This idea may sound like simple and natural but we didn't realize until
 2012.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Example
\series default
: Before that, one customer can get a marketing offer from us and then suddenly
 get a line decrease, simply because these two strategies did not talk to
 each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Sometimes I think, as analysts, we are too obsessed into building each individua
l strategies along, but forget the big picture, which is different strategies
 have to work together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So we decided to group customers to LOW, MEDIUM/LOW, MH, HIGH.
 Positive actions only happen in LOW and ML, negative actions only happen
 in HIGH.
 For Medium High, we leave it as grey area and has no action on it, neither
 positive or negative actions.
 So that we create a 
\series bold
grey area between good customers and bad customers, even if they migrate,
 it is hard for them to migrate directly from ML to H.

A lot of times you want to extract THE variables you are using in a formula,
 for example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Y = X + X‸2

\begin_layout Standard
Then depend on what's your background and the empirical context, there are

\begin_layout Standard
One: there is two variables there: X and X‸2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second: there is only one variable: X
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of empirical economist tend to think there is only one variable there,
 as they care about how to quantify the relations between X and Y, not the
 particular coefficient of X‸2 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more complex case is: using a categorical variable: Categorical variables
 do not appear in the model as their original format.
 R will think an K-class variable as K-1 variables using certain Contrast

\begin_layout Subsection
Model: Intuition of linear.tools

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of times when we build parametric models, especially linear models,
 we already have PRIOR KNOWLEDGE about how certain independent variables
 may impact the dependent variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, when we build models to forecast whether a customer will pay
 us or not, when know the Unemployment rate will contribute to delinquent
 rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Normally we use both the level form of U and the squared form of it.
 So you want to insure that the 
\series bold
combination
\series default
 of U and squared U has a positive impact on delinquency rate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that the
\series bold
 combined marginal impact 
\series default
here is not just coefficient of U + coefficient of squared U.
 You have to do 
\series bold
Partial Derivatives
\series default
 to get the true marginal impact.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A more complex case is, you may INTERACT this U with other variables, for
 example, you expect the 
\series bold
recession
\series default
 may hit the Low FICO/Low Income harder, than HIGH FICO/high Income people

 assumptions, test the

 (because you are using the squared unemployment, the when you visualize
 it, it is a quadratic curve, which may peak at some where) and also visualize
 it using ggplot2, ALL done in one function.

 and never change, because when you book the account, (booking is costly)

So when I graduated, I got graduate school offers from Cambridge and Oxford,
 but I also got the Duke offer.
 So I think, if I do graduate school in UK, I will probably stay in UK forever.
 So I decided, if I really want to come to America, this is time!

A lot of times my work is ac-hoc nature: we got data from other department,
 then my job is to clean it, summarize it and analyze it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can do them mechanically and never ask why.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Just quickly turnover or deliver

\begin_layout Enumerate
But I always want to know the underlying reason, why we do this, what's

\begin_layout Itemize
I love to learn new things, and I'm pretty much self-motivated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You saw in my resume I'm proficient in Python and Machine Learning, to be
 honest I never touch Python in my school, and I knew nothing about machine
 learning back in that time.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
But then in the past two years every night when I get off work, I spend
 some time, even half hour a day to read and learn those stuff..
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Now I can claim I know those stuff pretty well.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When you first start it is really hard, because after work I got exhausted,
 hungry and sleepy.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So first you have to force yourself but then you get used to it, and then
 there is a momentum building up and it becomes voluntary.

What loss forecasting does is to design a model with inputs as pricing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pricing is decided by Finance (19 floor).
 Different offer types and targeting group is decided by Marketing, which
 is in 18 floor.

\begin_layout Standard
So you see the three most important features of a product: risk, pricing,
 and targeting (and thus response rate) are controlled by three different
 department / floors.

\begin_layout Itemize
When you build new features on the existing systems, often there is

How if someone did not buy your model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not because your model is not robust or sounded, just because they don't
 like the result of your model, for example, your forecasting may suggest
 a completely opposite story that the management committee believe.

\begin_layout Standard
In my case, I'm doing loss forecasting for marketing.
 They question my model only when the loss forecasting is too high and kill
 their campaign.
