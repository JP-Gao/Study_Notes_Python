\begin_layout Enumerate
The Dimensionality of feature space is high.
 There are bunch of media features such as: exchange, publisher, app/website
 placement features, time of day, day of week, ad size etc.
 We also have several users features including: geo (city, state, country)
 and system-based features such as: device, connection, browser, OS etc.
 You can also grab extra user demographics from 3rd party data providers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The well-known Rarity problem where there are a very few clicks and even
 much less conversions.
 To put this in perspective you might have a CTR around 0.08% to 0.11% in
 the best case.
 Now multiply this with another 10% conversion rate which give us a conversion
 rate in the range of 0.008%!

\begin_layout Section
Real-Time Bidding (RTB)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first area of mobile advertising which can be improved by machine learning
 (ML) is Real-Time Bidding (RTB) traffic.
 In an RTB environment, Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs) need to determine the
 optimal amount to bid on every single specific impression.
 Most RTB-enabled exchanges will only allow a maximum response latency of
 100 milliseconds, meaning that a data-driven assessment of the impression
 has to be generated within an extremely short amount of time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to determine how much to bid, the algorithm needs to assess the
 probability of the impression resulting in good performance metrics, such
 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Click-through rate (CTR), 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Conversion/install rate (CR/IR),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
and even post-install events that enable to approximate Lifetime Value (LTV).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This assessment is done programmatically, utilizing data provided with the
 impression, either from the publisher or from a data management platform
 (DMP), as well as first party data from the advertiser as input.

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The process of analyzing segmented visitors can be thrilling, because it’s
 an opportunity to uncover some of the truths behind the numbers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Better understanding, easier to tell a business story.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Remember: Storytelling Means Everything to Your Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
BUT, labels on customers may not be clear! Segmentation may be overlapping.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Personalalization approch: biuld model directly on the customer level, so
 those featuers used in segmentation are just features for individuals.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Getting personalization right is much easier when there’s a solid understanding
 of the characteristics of the segments it is based on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can use Personalalization models to predict and then use Segmentation
 data to tell story.

CPM: Definition of 'Cost Per Thousand - CPM' The price of 1,000 advertisement
 impressions on one webpage.
 If a website publisher charges $2 CPM, that means an advertiser must pay

\series bold
multiple tags

 / labels at the same.
 One user may love music and computer science at the same time
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
So there is no way to do clustering at just one time
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You need to first choose music related featuresm, do clustering on whether
 a user likes music or not.
 Then run another clustering to decide for the computer science label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
That means, for each time, you just model one label.
 But you run the label multiple times to get all the labels you want.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Hierarchy
\series default
: Also even within the music label, there are further sublabels --- rock,
 pop, rap etc.
 So you have to run clustering in a hierarchical way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I means first decide all the pepople who like music, then within those people,
 clustering into different groups

Based on who they follow
\series default
: It's hard to directly do clustering on common users.
 But it is relatively easy to cluster those celebrities / influencers, they
 are most likely just has oen label --- either movie star, musician, or
 comupter scientist.
 So their labels are more

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Then we go back to the common users, to see what types of celebrities they
 follow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Or we can even bring the number of likes or retweets for each celebrities,
 using this as a weight to mearue how strong / close this following relation
 is.
 So the following relation is no longer 0 or 1 anymore, it may be 0, 1,
 2, continous integers.

Pagerank to measure importance/influence of user
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The importance of a user depends on number of followers, and also depend
 on the importance of those followers.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If an influential celebrity A follows B, that means A endorses some of his
 impotant to him
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Pagerank algorithm is using this idea to measure how importance/influence
 of a point in the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way it works is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Image you want to do a random work through all the social network, starting
 from point A, as A is following N people the probability that A travels
 to each followees 1/N.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then assume now we travel from A to B, then do a random walk to the people
 that B follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You keep doing one millions of time, and it turned out the probability/number
 of times of getting to a certain point will converge to a steady value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
That value is the score of the importance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the idea is: if the more people follow a point A, then it is easier to get
 their.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Path Find to Measure Importance of a User
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can think about this problem as a path finding problem: How to find
 the shortest parth to travel from one user to another user.

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you randomly select two points in the scoial network, both A and B have
 no common firends in the real world, but they both follow one musician
 in Twitter.

Model-Based
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Collaborative recommendation techniques are often classified as being either

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional user-based technique is said to be memory-based because
 the original rating database is held in memory and used directly for generating
 the recommendations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In model-based approaches, on the other hand, the raw data are first processed
 offline, as described for itembased filtering or some dimensionality reduction
 techniques.
 At run time, only the precomputed or “learned” model is required to make
 predictions.

Bug-free & New Featues vs Ship in Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
if the team were to fix every bug and build every new feature idea, the
 product would never launch.
 The PM needs to consider all of the new requests and decide if they should
 be prioritized for the current release or punted to a later time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unimportant Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don’t let your team do unimportant work.
 Sometimes big companies lose track of all the projects going on, and you
 might be assigned as the only PM for a team that’s really not delivering
 much value for the company.
 Ideally, you’d redirect the team to work on something more important.
 If that’s not possible, consider suggesting to your manager that the team
 be shut down (make sure you do your research and can support this) or consider
 switching to another team.
 It will be hard to get promoted launching a product that doesn’t matter.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is not the time to tackle all challenges, since you don’t even know

\begin_layout Subsection
Shipped Product
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result, shipped-software teams tend to have longer timelines, and the
 products require more project management and coordination between teams.
 Specs are more important because features are more formal and need to serve
 more audiences.
 User research and internal dogfooding (using early builds of the software)
 are also very important since you need to know if the product is good before
 it’s released.
 PMs who are good at project management and have good communication skills
 do well working on shipped software.
 Shipped software can also be great for people who want a good work/life
 balance, since there aren’t usually urgent issues that need to be fixed
 within hours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Shipped software is unique because it’s hard to update after launching.
 With shipped software, it’s important to get it right the first time.

The worry is that the "creators," that is the celebrities, journalists,

If 1 is greater than 3 (let’s call it a “positive ratio”), it could be worth
 clicking through to that person’s profile.
 If 1 is much greater than 3, they most certainly are at least worth looking
 at.
 If 3 is greater than 1 (the “negative ratio”) by a large margin, the likelihood
 that they’re a spammer or marketer is pretty good

Measure of Interaction for a Social Network

\begin_layout Standard
IPM (interactions per message): This basically tells you the average chance

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
IPM=\sum_{-30d}^{now}\frac{likes_{t}+replies_{t}+shares_{t}}{message_{t}\times N_{fans}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So if we really want to measure engagement accurately then you only want
 to take into account a couple of things: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How many unique people actually "engaged" or otherwise have taken an action
 based on your content 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How many unique people saw your content before engaging 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And that's how we ended up with IPV (interactions per unique view) which
 is measured on content level, but can easily be scaled up to a brand level
 serving as an average of all underlying content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
IPM=\sum_{-30d}^{now}\frac{likes_{t}+replies_{t}+shares_{t}}{views}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
publishing a message doesn't necessarily mean that all your fans end up
 seeing it.

 fan base saw your content in the end (and thus how well it performed in
 Facebook's Edge Rank algorithm).

Impression (online media) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An impression (in the context of online advertising) is when an ad is fetched
 from its source, and is countable.
 Whether the ad is clicked is not taken into account.[1] Each time an ad
 is fetched it is counted as one impression.[2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the possibility of click fraud, robotic activity is usually filtered
 and excluded, and a more technical definition is given for accounting purposes
 by the IAB, a standards and watchdog industry group: "Impression" is a
 measurement of responses from a Web server to a page request from the user
 browser, which is filtered from robotic activity and error codes, and is
 recorded at a point as close as possible to opportunity to see the page
 by the user.[3][4]

Click-Through Rate (CTR rate)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Click-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link
 to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CTR is a metric that is used to analyze emails, webpages and online search
 result pages (Google, Bing, Yahoo etc).
 CTR is normally used to measure the success of marketing efforts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CTR EXAMPLES
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some common examples of where CTR can be measured include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A call-to-action link in an email A hyperlink on a landing page .A PPC ad
 on a Google search results page
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Click-through rate is calculated by the number of clicks on an element divided
 by the number of people who have seen that element
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CTR should not be mistaken for conversion rate.
 Conversion rate is the percentage of people who take a desired action.
 CTR, on the other hand, is normally associated with an action leading up
 to a conversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CTR can be used to gain useful insights in A/B testing, as a secondary metric
 alongside the primary conversion metric.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ad Viewability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WHAT IS AD VIEWABILITY?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ad viewability is the concept of how visible ads on a website or mobile
 app are to users.
 For an ad to be considered “viewed”, at least 50% of the banner or creative
 must display on screen for more than one second, as defined by the Internet
 Advertising Bureau’s standard for what consists a viewable impression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ad viewability is a relatively new concept in digital advertising, but has
 become a hot topic ever since a report from comScore showed that 54% of
 display ads were not being seen, despite advertisers paying for them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over time, however, advertisers began to question the practice of using
 ads served as a proxy for ads viewed.
 For example, it occurred to them that if an ad appeared 
\series bold
below the fold
\series default
 at the bottom of a webpage, but a user never scrolled down far enough to
 see it, that impression should not be counted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Publishers can also make their sites mobile-friendly by using responsive
 templates that resize according to the device where it is being viewed.
 This guarantees a good user experience no matter the device (tablet, phone
 or desktop).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ad viewability also improves through good design principles: a clear visual
 hierarchy, symmetry and pleasing proportions, white space and clean design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another key consideration for ad viewability is speed.
 Sites that are laden with ads from multiple ad networks can typically take
 a long time to load, which can result in a lower ad viewability as users
 click away before the ads load.
 Techniques for speeding up ad delivery can greatly improve ad viewability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Search Engine Marketing (SEM / SEO)

 as well as several other search marketing tactic
\end_layout

Headline Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WHAT IS HEADLINE TESTING?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
“Headline testing” refers to the process of developing multiple title variations
 for an article or piece of online media, which can then be tested on multiple
 audience segments of to determine which one performs the best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Landing page 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In online marketing, a landing page, sometimes known as a "lead capture
 page" or a "lander", is a single web page that appears in response to clicking
 on a search engine optimized search result or an online advertisement.
 The landing page will usually display directed sales copy that is a logical
 extension of the advertisement, search result or link.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Landing pages are often linked to from social media, email campaigns or
 search engine marketing campaigns in order to enhance the effectiveness
 of the advertisements.

Conversion (rate)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A conversion occurs when a user completes some predetermined action on your
 site.
 Conversions do not have to be tied to monetary goals, and common examples
 are when a user completes an order, clicks a button, submits a lead generation
 form, reaches a specific page, or any other goal of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IDENTIFYING AREAS TO OPTIMIZE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Typically, you will want to begin optimizing the portion of your conversion
 funnel that receives the greatest amount of traffic or generates the greatest
 numbers of conversions.
 By focusing on these pages you will be able to see the results of your
 changes faster and have a larger impact on your business.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Other potential places to start include your 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
highest value pages or
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
pages that are underperforming compared to the rest of your site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Again, improving these areas can have the greatest immediate impact on your
 conversion goals.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
For example, a clothing retailer may find that their page for hats receives
 a lot of traffic but has a conversion rate that is much lower than the
 rest of the site.
 By improving the conversion rate of that page, the retailer will be able
 to see a big improvement in sales for their CRO efforts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Call To Action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A call to action (CTA) is a prompt on a website that tells the user to take
 some specified action.
 A call to action is typically written as a command, such as ‘Sign Up’ or
 ‘Buy Now’ and generally takes the form of a button or hyperlink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For example, on a blog the CTAs might look like:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Read more articles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sign-up for our newsletter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Support our sponsor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Share on social media
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Whereas on an ecommerce site, the CTAs may be more commercially focused:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Add to cart
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Checkout
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Buy now
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Add to wishlist
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Marketers employ a number of strategies for creating CTAs.
 Below is a list of some common ones:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Good Design: A colorful button that contrasts with the color of the page
 is a good strategy to get the user’s attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
High Visibility: Because the call to action should be the most noticeable
 thing on the page, the font size should be large enough to command attention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Clear Benefit: Stating a clear benefit that the user will get from completing
 the transaction is an effective way to get them to click.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Actionable Text: A call to action written in the imperative mood gives a
 clear and direct command of what to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Short in Length: A good call to action should be a short phrase, not a sentence.
 Most are no longer than five words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Guarantees That Reduce Perceived Risk: Any type of money-back guarantee
 or short free trial period helps convince the user that there is little
 risk in completing the transaction.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Effect of robots on experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For some websites robots are thought to provide up to half the pageviews
 on the site (Kohavi et al.
 2004).
 Since many robots have the same characteristics as human users it is difficult
 to clearly delineate between the two.
 Benign or simple robots can often be filtered by basic characteristics
 (e.g.
 user agent, IP address) but manymodern robots use sophisticated techniques
 to escape detections and filtering (Tan and Kumar 2002).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ad Rank
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ad Rank: A value that's used to determine your ad position (where ads are
 shown on a page) and whether your ads will show at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ad Rank is calculated using your bid amount, the components of Quality Score
 (expected clickthrough rate, ad relevance, and landing page experience)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ad Rank determines your ad position -- where your ad shows on the page in
 relation to other ads -- and whether your ads are eligible to show at all.
 The main components of your Ad Rank are your bids and the quality of your
 ads and website.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also incorporate the expected impact from your extensions and other ad
 formats when computing your Ad Rank.
 When estimating the expected impact of extensions and ad formats, we consider
 such factors as the relevance, clickthrough rates, and the prominence of
 the extensions or formats on the search results page.
 So even if your competition has higher bids than yours, you can still win
 a higher position at a lower price by using highly relevant keywords and
 ads.
 Your Ad Rank is recalculated each time your ad is eligible to appear and
 competes in an auction, so your ad position can fluctuate each time depending
 on your competition at that moment.

 your ads, you see a 5% decrease in cost per engagement.

You already know the most common effect-size measure, as the correlation/regress
ion coefficients r and R are actually measures of effect size.
 Because r covers the whole range of relationship strengths, from no relationshi
p whatsoever (zero) to a perfect relationship (1, or -1), it is telling
 us exactly how large the relationship really is between the variables we've
 studied -- and is independent of how many people were tested.
 Cohen provided rules of thumb for interpreting these effect sizes, suggesting
 that an r of |.1| represents a 'small' effect size, |.3| represents a 'medium'
 effect size and |.5| represents a 'large' effect size.

 Imagine an experiment with k buckets, where bucket i receives p percent

 Given that we know the total number of users who are bucketed into the
 experiment, we can model the number of users in each bucket jointly as
 a multinomial distribution.
 Furthermore, we can perform a goodness of fit test to see if the actual
 observed count deviates from the expected count.
 If we see that the traffic allocation

 In the past, we leveraged the binomial test so that each bucket was compared
 to its expected bucket count.
 However, in situations where an experiment has many buckets, we can quickly
 run into the problems of multiple hypothesis testing.
 Below, we plot the probability of getting at least one false positive as
 a function of the number of independent buckets, which is simply 1 - (1
 - p)^k where p is the probability of a getting a false positive (often
 set at 5%).
 The increase in false positives rate in a properly designed experiment
 when multiple buckets are involved is fairly high: Under the null hypothesis,
 with 5 buckets, one would expect to see at least one of them be imbalanced
 more than 20 percent of the time.

The multinomial test can protect us from the woes of multiple hypothesis

 problematic.
 To provide more guidance, we run additional binomial tests in cases when
 the multinomial test flags an experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Suppose we have a board game that depends on the roll of one die (see dice)
 and attaches special importance to rolling a 6.
 In a particular game, the die is rolled 235 times, and 6 comes up 51 times.
 If the dice is fair, we would expect 6 to come up 235/6 = 39.17 times.
 Is the proportion of 6s significantly higher than would be expected by
 chance, on the null hypothesis of a fair dice? To find an answer to this
 question using the binomial test, we use the binomial distribution B(235,1/6)
 to calculate the probability of 51 or more sixes in a sample of 235 if
 the true probability of rolling a 6 on each trial is 1/6.
 This is done by adding up the probability of getting exactly 51 sixes,
 exactly 52 sixes, and so on up to 235.

Bucket System and Carryover Effects

Some online experimentation platforms, including at Bing, Google, and Yahoo,

 The bucket system randomizes users into different buckets and then assigns
 buckets to experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One big drawback with the “bucket system” is its vulnerability to carryover
 effects, where the same users who were impacted by the first experiment
 are being used for the follow-on experiment.

\series bold

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you're a marketplace like Airbnb, eBay, or Etsy.
 You want to make it easier for marketplace sellers (people renting out
 their homes or selling items) to price their items, so you launch an A/B
 test where 50% of sellers see an algorithmic price suggestion and 50% of
 sellers don't.
 (Note that you can't really run the A/B test against users, since you don't
 want different users to see different prices for the same listings, which
 is why your A/B test is split on sellers instead.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, without your A/B test, a user may have happily rented a room
 or bought an item from a seller in your control group, but now that your
 A/B test is showing better prices in your test group, he ends up purchasing
 from a test seller instead.
 This difference will disappear once all sellers get your pricing algorithm,
 but in the meantime, your test group is effectively stealing from your
 control: not only are test metrics going up when this cannibalization happens,
 but it also makes control metric go down.
 Your metrics, as a result, are overcounting.

 Shying away from incremental changes that materially improve the product
 is simply not a good policy.
 A good financial portfolio balances safe bets that give predictable, albeit
 less than astronomical, return, and some higher-risk, higher-reward bets.
 Product portfolio management is not very different in that regard.

 That said, there are lots of things we cannot, or perhaps should not, test.
 Some changes are designed to result in network effects which user-bucketed
 A/B testing won’t capture (although other techniques do exist to quantify
 such effects).
 Some features do not work when given only to a random percentage of people.
 For example, Group DMs are not a feature to use in a plain A/B test, because
 chances are the lucky people who get the feature would want to message
 those who don’t have it, which makes the feature essentially useless.

 Such a decision is made when, as an organization, we believe it’s the right

 We believe there are greater gains to be had from a large release than

 release that might get more customers trying it and using it.
 It’s a trade-off the product leadership chooses to make.
 And are we going to A/B test incremental changes to such a new features
 after they launch? You bet! As ideas mature, we guide their evolution using
 well-established scientific principles — and experimentation is a key part
 of the process.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the high level answer, if you have a research question where you want
 to understand the effect of a treatment and have some certainty around
 your estimates, a standard a/b test experiment will be best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Matt Gershoff, “

If on the other hand, you actually care about optimization, rather than
 understanding, bandits are often the way to go.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Usage Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if we wish to test which of three titles works for an article
 on a news website, we know that the article will be 
\series bold
featured on our front page for a few hours only
\series default
.
 This means we have to quickly detect the better performing title and also
 exploit that knowledge within the timeframe of a few hours.
 In this case, we can use a multi-armed bandit approach, which helps us
 do just that.
 In short, this approach continuously splits the traffic between the variations
 according to the performance measured so far and the level of certainty
 gained each step of the way.
 This approach trades-off some of the certainty about which is “really”
 the best variation in exchange for quicker convergence.

\begin_layout Itemize
A Changing World.
 Matt explains that by letting the bandit method always leave some chance
 to select the poorer performing option, you give it a chance to ‘reconsider’
 the option effectiveness.
 It provides a working framework for swapping out low performing options
 with fresh options, in a continuous process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
a) Conversion rates don’t change over time.

b) Displaying a variation and observing a conversion happen instantaneously.

 1.

 12:02 Visitor A converts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
c) Samples in the bandit algorithm are independent of each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A/B testing is a fairly robust algorithm when these assumptions are violated.
 A/B testing doesn’t care much if conversion rates change over the test
 period – i.e., if Monday is different from Saturday, just make sure your
 test has the same number of Mondays and Saturdays and you are fine.

Consider a set of contexts X , a set of actions A , and rewards in R .
 In each round, the player obtains a context x ∈ X , plays an action a ∈

 the context and the issued action.
 The aim of the player is to play actions such as to maximize the cumulative
 rewards.
\end_layout

a posterior distribution 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle P(\theta|\mathcal{D})\propto P(\mathcal{D}|\theta)P(\theta)}$
\end_inset

, where P ( D | θ ) is the likelihood function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thompson sampling consists in playing the action {
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle a^{\ast}\in\mathcal{A}}$
\end_inset

} according to the probability that it maximizes the expected reward, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\displaystyle \int\mathbb{I}[\mathbb{E}(r|a,x,\theta)=\max_{a'}\mathbb{E}(r|a',x,\theta)]P(\theta|{\mathcal{D}})\,d\theta,}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{I}$
\end_inset

 is the indicator function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, the rule is implemented by sampling, in each round, a parameter
 θ 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 from the posterior 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\theta|\mathcal{D})$
\end_inset

, and choosing the action 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\ast}$
\end_inset

 that maximizes
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \mathbb{E}[r|\theta^{\ast},a^{\ast},x]}$
\end_inset

 ], i.e.
 the expected reward given the parameter, the action and the current context.
 Conceptually, this means that the player instantiates his beliefs randomly
 in each round, and then he acts optimally according to them.

Contextual Bandits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
http://hunch.net/?p=298
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A standard mathematical setting for this situation is “k-Armed Bandits”,
 often with various relevant embellishments.
 The k-Armed Bandit setting works on a round-by-round basis.
 On each round:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A policy chooses arm a from 1 of k arms (i.e.
 1 of k ads).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world reveals the reward ra of the chosen arm (i.e.
 whether the ad is clicked on).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As information is accumulated over multiple rounds, a good policy might
 converge on a good choice of arm (i.e.
 ad).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This setting (and its variants) fails to capture a critical phenomenon:
 each of these displayed ads are done in the context of a search or other
 webpage.
 To model this, we might think of a different setting where on each round:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world announces some context information x (think of this as a high
 dimensional bit vector if that helps).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A policy chooses arm a from 1 of k arms (i.e.
 1 of k ads).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The world reveals the reward ra of the chosen arm (i.e.
 whether the ad is clicked on).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can check that this is a critical distinction in 2 ways.
 First, note that policies using x can encode much more rich decisions than
 a policy not using x.
 Just think about: “if a search has the word flowers display a flower advertisem
ent”.
 Second, we can try to reduce this setting to the k-Armed Bandit setting,
 and note that it can not be done well.
 There are two methods that I know of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Run a different k-Armed Bandit for every value of x.
 The amount of information required to do well scales linearly in the number
 of contexts.
 In contrast, good supervised learning algorithms often require information
 which is (essentially) independent of the number of contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Take some set of policies and treat every policy h(x) as a different arm.
 This removes an explicit dependence on the number of contexts, but it creates
 a linear dependence on the number of policies.
 Via Occam’s razor/VC dimension/Margin bounds, we already know that supervised
 learning requires experience much smaller than the number of policies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know these are bad reductions by contrast to direct methods for solving
 the problem.
 The first algorithm for solving this problem is EXP4 (page 19 = 66) which
 has a regret with respect to the best policy in a set of O( T0.5 (ln |H|)0.5)
 where T is the number of rounds and |H| is the number of policies.
 (Dividing by T gives error-rate like quantities.) This result is independent
 of the number of contexts x and only weakly dependent (similar to supervised
 learning) on the number of policies.

 to look at whether those groups have different means.So that Explained SS
 = Between Group SS = Treatment SS.

Recall from the model (3.5) that associated with each observation is an error
 term ε.
 Due to the presence of these error terms, even if we knew the true regression
 line (i.e.
 even if β0 and β1 were known), we would not be able to perfectly predict
 Y from X.
 RSE is the estimate of std of the error term

 The general conclusion from these studies is that the consequences of such
 violations are less severe than previously thought.
 Although these conclusions should not entirely discourage anyone from being
 concerned about the normality assumption, they have increased the overall
 popularity of the distribution-dependent statistical tests in all areas
 of research."[9]

 differ from each other.

For example, suppose that a medical trial compares four treatments.
 The ANOVA F-test can be used to assess whether any of the treatments is
 on average superior, or inferior, to the others versus the null hypothesis
 that all four treatments yield the same mean response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The advantage of the ANOVA F-test is that we do not need to pre-specify
 which treatments are to be compared, and we do not need to adjust for making
 multiple comparisons.
